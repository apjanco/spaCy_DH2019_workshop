      "<p>Sometime in the course of that afternoon, two working men met with friendly greeting at the stile\n",
      "so often named. One was a thorough specimen of a Manchester man; born of factory workers, and\n",
      "himself bred up in youth, and living in manhood, among the mills. He was below the middle size and\n",
      "slightly made; there was almost a stunted look about him; and his wan, colourless face gave you the\n",
      "idea, that in his childhood he had suffered from the scanty living consequent upon bad times and\n",
      "improvident habits. His features were strongly marked, though not irregular, and their expression\n",
      "was extreme earnestness; resolute either for good or evil; a sort of latent, stern enthusiasm. At\n",
      "the time of which I write, the good predominated over the bad in the countenance, and he was one\n",
      "from whom a stranger would have asked a favour with tolerable faith that it would be granted. He was\n",
      "accompanied by his wife, who might, without exaggeration, have been called a lovely woman, although\n",
      "now her face was swollen with crying, and often hidden behind her apron. She had the fresh beauty of\n",
      "the agricultural districts; and somewhat of the deficiency of sense in her countenance, which is\n",
      "likewise characteristic of the rural inhabitants in comparison with the natives of the manufacturing\n",
      "towns. She was far advanced in pregnancy, which perhaps occasioned the overpowering and hysterical\n",
      "nature of her grief. The friend whom they met was more handsome and less sensible-looking than the\n",
      "man I have just described; he seemed hearty and hopeful, and although his age was greater, yet there\n",
      "was far more of youth's buoyancy in his appearance. He was tenderly carrying a baby in arms, while\n",
      "his wife, a delicate, fragile-looking woman, limping in her gait, bore another of the same age;\n",
      "little, feeble twins, inheriting the frail appearance of their mother.</p>\n",
      "<p>The last-mentioned man was the first to speak, while a sudden look of sympathy dimmed his\n",
      "gladsome face. \"Well, John, how goes it with you?\" and, in a lower voice, he added, \"Any news of\n",
      "Esther, yet?\" Meanwhile the wives greeted each other like old friends, the soft and plaintive voice\n",
      "of the mother of the twins seeming to call forth only fresh sobs from Mrs. Barton.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come, women,\" said John Barton, \"you've both walked far enough. My Mary expects to have her bed\n",
      "in three weeks; and as for you, Mrs. Wilson, you know you're but a cranky sort of a body at the best\n",
      "of times.\" This was said so kindly, that no offence could be taken. \"Sit you down here; the grass is\n",
      "well nigh dry by this time; and you're neither of you nesh <ref target=\"#footnote1\">[1]</ref> folk\n",
      "about taking cold. Stay,\" he added, with some tenderness, \"here's my pocket-handkerchief to spread\n",
      "under you, to save the gowns women always think so much of; and now, Mrs. Wilson, give me the baby,\n",
      "I may as well carry him, while you talk and comfort my wife; poor thing, she takes on sadly about\n",
      "Esther.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>These arrangements were soon completed: the two women sat down on the blue cotton handkerchiefs\n",
      "of their husbands, and the latter, each carrying a baby, set off for a further walk; but as soon as\n",
      "Barton had turned his back upon his wife, his countenance fell back into an expression of gloom.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then you've heard nothing of Esther, poor lass?\" asked Wilson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, nor shan't, as I take it. My mind is, she's gone off with somebody. My wife frets, and\n",
      "thinks she's drowned herself, but I tell her, folks don't care to put on their best clothes to drown\n",
      "themselves; and Mrs. Bradshaw (where she lodged, you know) says the last time she set eyes on her\n",
      "was last Tuesday, when she came down stairs, dressed in her Sunday gown, and with a new ribbon in\n",
      "her bonnet, and gloves on her hands, like the lady she was so fond of thinking herself.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She was as pretty a creature as ever the sun shone on.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, she was a farrantly <ref target=\"#footnote2\">[2]</ref> lass; more's the pity now,\" added\n",
      "Barton, with a sigh. \"You see them Buckinghamshire people as comes to work in Manchester, has quite\n",
      "a different look with them to us Manchester folk. You'll not see among the Manchester wenches such\n",
      "fresh rosy cheeks, or such black lashes to gray eyes (making them look like black), as my wife and\n",
      "Esther had. I never seed two such pretty women for sisters; never. Not but what beauty is a sad\n",
      "snare. Here was Esther so puffed up, that there was no holding her in. Her spirit was always up, if\n",
      "I spoke ever so little in the way of advice to her; my wife spoiled her, it is true, for you see she\n",
      "was so much older than Esther she was more like a mother to her, doing every thing for her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wonder she ever left you,\" observed his friend.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's the worst of factory work, for girls. They can earn so much when work is plenty, that\n",
      "they can maintain themselves any how. My Mary shall never work in a factory, that I'm determined on.\n",
      "You see Esther spent her money in dress, thinking to set off her pretty face; and got to come home\n",
      "so late at night, that at last I told her my mind: my missis thinks I spoke crossly, but I meant\n",
      "right, for I loved Esther, if it was only for Mary's sake. Says I, 'Esther, I see what you'll end at\n",
      "with your artificials, and your fly-away veils, and stopping out when honest women are in their\n",
      "beds; you'll be a street-walker, Esther, and then, don't you go to think I'll have you darken my\n",
      "door, though my wife is your sister.' So says she, 'Don't trouble yourself, John. I'll pack up and\n",
      "be off now, for I'll never stay to hear myself called as you call me.' She flushed up like a\n",
      "turkey-cock, and I thought fire would come out of her eyes; but when she saw Mary cry (for Mary\n",
      "can't abide words in a house), she went and kissed her, and said she was not so bad as I thought\n",
      "her. So we talked more friendly, for, as I said, I liked the lass well enough, and her pretty looks,\n",
      "and her cheery ways. But she said (and at the time I thought there was sense in what she said) we\n",
      "should be much better friends if she went into lodgings, and only came to see us now and then.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then you still were friendly. Folks said you'd cast her off, and said you'd never speak to her\n",
      "again.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Folks always make one a deal worse than one is,\" said John Barton, testily. \"She came many a\n",
      "time to our house after she left off living with us. Last Sunday se'nnight—no! it was this very last\n",
      "Sunday, she came to drink a cup of tea with Mary; and that was the last time we set eyes on\n",
      "her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Was she any ways different in her manner?\" asked Wilson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, I don't know. I have thought several times since, that she was a bit quieter, and more\n",
      "womanly-like; more gentle, and more blushing, and not so riotous and noisy. She comes in, toward\n",
      "four o'clock, when afternoon church was loosing, and she goes and hangs her bonnet up on the old\n",
      "nail we used to call hers, while she lived with us. I remember thinking what a pretty lass she was,\n",
      "as she sat on a low stool by Mary, who was rocking herself, and in rather a poor way. She laughed\n",
      "and cried by turns, but all so softly and gently, like a child, that I couldn't find in my heart to\n",
      "scold her, especially as Mary was fretting already. One thing I do remember I did say, and pretty\n",
      "sharply too. She took our little Mary by the waist, and—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou must leave off calling her 'little' Mary, she's growing up into as fine a lass as one can\n",
      "see on a summer's day; more of her mother's stock than thine,\" interrupted Wilson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, well, I call her 'little,' because her mother's name is Mary. But, as I was saying, she\n",
      "takes Mary in a coaxing sort of way, and, 'Mary,' says she, 'what should you think if I sent for you\n",
      "some day and made a lady of you?' So I could not stand such talk as that to my girl, and I said,\n",
      "'Thou'd best not put that nonsense i' the girl's head I can tell thee; I'd rather see her earning\n",
      "her bread by the sweat of her brow, as the Bible tells her she should do, ay, though she never got\n",
      "butter to her bread, than be like a do-nothing lady, worrying shopmen all morning, and screeching at\n",
      "her pianny all afternoon, and going to bed without having done a good turn to any one of God's\n",
      "creatures but herself.'\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou never could abide the gentlefolk,\" said Wilson, half amused at his friend's vehemence.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And what good have they ever done me that I should like them?\" asked Barton, the latent fire\n",
      "lighting up his eye: and bursting forth, he continued, \"If I am sick, do they come and nurse me? If\n",
      "my child lies dying (as poor Tom lay, with his white wan lips quivering, for want of better food\n",
      "than I could give him), does the rich man bring the wine or broth that might save his life? If I am\n",
      "out of work for weeks in the bad times, and winter comes, with black frost, and keen east wind, and\n",
      "there is no coal for the grate, and no clothes for the bed, and the thin bones are seen through the\n",
      "ragged clothes, does the rich man share his plenty with me, as he ought to do, if his religion\n",
      "wasn't a humbug? When I lie on my death-bed, and Mary (bless her) stands fretting, as I know she\n",
      "will fret,\" and here his voice faltered a little, \"will a rich lady come and take her to her own\n",
      "home if need be, till she can look round, and see what best to do? No, I tell you, it's the poor,\n",
      "and the poor only, as does such things for the poor. Don't think to come over me with th' old tale,\n",
      "that the rich know nothing of the trials of the poor. I say, if they don't know, they ought to know.\n",
      "We're their slaves as long as we can work; we pile up their fortunes with the sweat of our brows;\n",
      "and yet we are to live as separate as if we were in two worlds; ay, as separate as Dives and\n",
      "Lazarus, with a great gulf betwixt us: but I know who was best off then,\" and he wound up his speech\n",
      "with a low chuckle that had no mirth in it.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, neighbour,\" said Wilson, \"all that may be very true, but what I want to know now is about\n",
      "Esther—when did you last hear of her?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, she took leave of us that Sunday night in a very loving way, kissing both wife Mary, and\n",
      "daughter Mary (if I must not call her little), and shaking hands with me; but all in a cheerful sort\n",
      "of manner, so we thought nothing about her kisses and shakes. But on Wednesday night comes Mrs.\n",
      "Bradshaw's son with Esther's box, and presently Mrs. Bradshaw follows with the key; and when we\n",
      "began to talk, we found Esther told her she was coming back to live with us, and would pay her\n",
      "week's money for not giving notice; and on Tuesday night she carried off a little bundle (her best\n",
      "clothes were on her back, as I said before), and told Mrs. Bradshaw not to hurry herself about the\n",
      "big box, but bring it when she had time. So of course she thought she should find Esther with us;\n",
      "and when she told her story, my missis set up such a screech, and fell down in a dead swoon. Mary\n",
      "ran up with water for her mother, and I thought so much about my wife, I did not seem to care at all\n",
      "for Esther. But the next day I asked all the neighbours (both our own and Bradshaw's), and they'd\n",
      "none of 'em heard or seen nothing of her. I even went to a policeman, a good enough sort of man, but\n",
      "a fellow I'd never spoke to before because of his livery, and I asks him if his 'cuteness could find\n",
      "any thing out for us. So I believe he asks other policemen; and one on 'em had seen a wench, like\n",
      "our Esther, walking very quickly, with a bundle under her arm, on Tuesday night, toward eight\n",
      "o'clock, and get into a hackney coach, near Hulme Church, and we don't know th' number, and can't\n",
      "trace it no further. I'm sorry enough for the girl, for bad's come over her, one way or another, but\n",
      "I'm sorrier for my wife. She loved her next to me and Mary, and she's never been the same body since\n",
      "poor Tom's death. However, let's go back to them; your old woman may have done her good.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>As they walked homewards with a brisker pace, Wilson expressed a wish that they still were the\n",
      "near neighbours they once had been.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Still our Alice lives in the cellar under No. 14, in Barber Street, and if you'd only speak the\n",
      "word she'd be with you in five minutes, to keep your wife company when she's lonesome. Though I'm\n",
      "Alice's brother, and perhaps ought not to say it, I will say there's none more ready to help with\n",
      "heart or hand than she is. Though she may have done a hard day's wash, there's not a child ill\n",
      "within the street but Alice goes to offer to sit up, and does sit up too, though may be she's to be\n",
      "at her work by six next morning.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She's a poor woman, and can feel for the poor, Wilson,\" was Barton's reply; and then he added,\n",
      "\"Thank you kindly for your offer, and mayhap I may trouble her to be a bit with my wife, for while\n",
      "I'm at work, and Mary's at school, I know she frets above a bit. See, there's Mary!\" and the\n",
      "father's eye brightened, as in the distance, among a group of girls, he spied his only daughter, a\n",
      "bonny lassie of thirteen or so, who came bounding along to meet and to greet her father, in a manner\n",
      "which showed that the stern-looking man had a tender nature within. The two men had crossed the last\n",
      "stile while Mary loitered behind to gather some buds of the coming hawthorn, when an over-grown lad\n",
      "came past her, and snatched a kiss, exclaiming, \"For old acquaintance sake, Mary.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Take that for old acquaintance sake, then,\" said the girl, blushing rosy red, more with anger\n",
      "than shame, as she slapped his face. The tones of her voice called back her father and his friend,\n",
      "and the aggressor proved to be the eldest son of the latter, the senior by eighteen years of his\n",
      "little brothers.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Here, children, instead o' kissing and quarrelling, do ye each take a baby, for if Wilson's arms\n",
      "be like mine they are heartily tired.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary sprang forward to take her father's charge, with a girl's fondness for infants, and with\n",
      "some little foresight of the event soon to happen at home; while young Wilson seemed to lose his\n",
      "rough, cubbish nature as he crowed and cooed to his little brother.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Twins is a great trial to a poor man, bless 'em,\" said the half-proud, half-weary father, as he\n",

      "<p>\"Here we are, wife; didst thou think thou'd lost us?\" quoth hearty-voiced Wilson, as the two\n",
      "women rose and shook themselves in preparation for their homeward walk. Mrs. Barton was evidently\n",
      "soothed, if not cheered, by the unburdening of her fears and thoughts to her friend; and her\n",
      "approving look went far to second her husband's invitation that the whole party should adjourn from\n",
      "Green Heys Fields to tea, at the Bartons' house. The only faint opposition was raised by Mrs.\n",
      "Wilson, on account of the lateness of the hour at which they would probably return, which she feared\n",
      "on her babies' account.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Now, hold your tongue, missis, will you,\" said her husband, good-temperedly. \"Don't you know\n",
      "them brats never goes to sleep till long past ten? and haven't you a shawl, under which you can tuck\n",
      "one lad's head, as safe as a bird's under its wing? And as for t'other one, I'll put it in my pocket\n",

      "<p>\"Or I can lend you another shawl,\" suggested Mrs. Barton.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, any thing rather than not stay.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The matter being decided, the party proceeded home, through many half-finished streets, all so\n",
      "like one another that you might have easily been bewildered and lost your way. Not a step, however,\n",
      "did our friends lose; down this entry, cutting off that corner, until they turned out of one of\n",
      "these innumerable streets into a little paved court, having the backs of houses at the end opposite\n",
      "to the opening, and a gutter running through the middle to carry off household slops, washing suds,\n",
      "&amp;c. The women who lived in the court were busy taking in strings of caps, frocks, and various\n",
      "articles of linen, which hung from side to side, dangling so low, that if our friends had been a few\n",
      "minutes sooner, they would have had to stoop very much, or else the half-wet clothes would have\n",
      "flapped in their faces; but although the evening seemed yet early when they were in the open\n",
      "fields—among the pent-up houses, night, with its mists, and its darkness, had already begun to\n",
      "fall.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many greetings were given and exchanged between the Wilsons and these women, for not long ago\n",
      "they had also dwelt in this court.</p>\n",
      "<p>Two rude lads, standing at a disorderly looking house-door, exclaimed, as Mary Barton (the\n",
      "daughter) passed, \"Eh, look! Polly Barton's gotten a sweetheart.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course this referred to young Wilson, who stole a look to see how Mary took the idea. He saw\n",
      "her assume the air of a young fury, and to his next speech she answered not a word.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Barton produced the key of the door from her pocket; and on entering the house-place it\n",
      "seemed as if they were in total darkness, except one bright spot, which might be a cat's eye, or\n",
      "might be, what it was, a red-hot fire, smouldering under a large piece of coal, which John Barton\n",
      "immediately applied himself to break up, and the effect instantly produced was warm and glowing\n",
      "light in every corner of the room. To add to this (although the coarse yellow glare seemed lost in\n",
      "the ruddy glow from the fire), Mrs. Barton lighted a dip by sticking it in the fire, and having\n",
      "placed it satisfactorily in a tin candlestick, began to look further about her, on hospitable\n",
      "thoughts intent. The room was tolerably large, and possessed many conveniences. On the right of the\n",
      "door, as you entered, was a longish window, with a broad ledge. On each side of this, hung\n",
      "blue-and-white check curtains, which were now drawn, to shut in the friends met to enjoy themselves.\n",
      "Two geraniums, unpruned and leafy, which stood on the sill, formed a further defence from out-door\n",
      "pryers. In the corner between the window and the fire-side was a cupboard, apparently full of plates\n",
      "and dishes, cups and saucers, and some more nondescript articles, for which one would have fancied\n",
      "their possessors could find no use—such as triangular pieces of glass to save carving knives and\n",
      "forks from dirtying table-cloths. However, it was evident Mrs. Barton was proud of her crockery and\n",
      "glass, for she left her cupboard door open, with a glance round of satisfaction and pleasure. On the\n",
      "opposite side to the door and window was the staircase, and two doors; one of which (the nearest to\n",
      "the fire) led into a sort of little back kitchen, where dirty work, such as washing up dishes, might\n",
      "be done, and whose shelves served as larder, and pantry, and storeroom, and all. The other door,\n",
      "which was considerably lower, opened into the coal-hole—the slanting closet under the stairs; from\n",
      "which, to the fire-place, there was a gay-coloured piece of oil-cloth laid. The place seemed almost\n",
      "crammed with furniture (sure sign of good times among the mills). Beneath the window was a dresser\n",
      "with three deep drawers. Opposite the fire-place was a table, which I should call a Pembroke, only\n",
      "that it was made of deal, and I cannot tell how far such a name may be applied to such humble\n",
      "material. On it, resting against the wall, was a bright green japanned tea-tray, having a couple of\n",
      "scarlet lovers embracing in the middle. The fire-light danced merrily on this, and really (setting\n",
      "all taste but that of a child's aside) it gave a richness of colouring to that side of the room. It\n",
      "was in some measure propped up by a crimson tea-caddy, also of japan ware. A round table on one\n",
      "branching leg really for use, stood in the corresponding corner to the cupboard; and, if you can\n",
      "picture all this with a washy, but clean stencilled pattern on the walls, you can form some idea of\n",
      "John Barton's home.</p>\n",
      "<p>The tray was soon hoisted down, and before the merry chatter of cups and saucers began, the women\n",
      "disburdened themselves of their out-of-door things, and sent Mary up stairs with them. Then came a\n",
      "long whispering, and chinking of money, to which Mr. and Mrs. Wilson were too polite to attend;\n",
      "knowing, as they did full well, that it all related to the preparations for hospitality; hospitality\n",
      "that, in their turn, they should have such pleasure in offering. So they tried to be busily occupied\n",
      "with the children, and not to hear Mrs. Barton's directions to Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Run, Mary dear, just round the corner, and get some fresh eggs at Tipping's (you may get one\n",
      "a-piece, that will be five-pence), and see if he has any nice ham cut, that he would let us have a\n",
      "pound of.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Say two pounds, missis, and don't be stingy,\" chimed in the husband.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, a pound and a half, Mary. And get it Cumberland ham, for Wilson comes from there-away, and\n",
      "it will have a sort of relish of home with it he'll like,—and Mary\" (seeing the lassie fain to be\n",
      "off), \"you must get a pennyworth of milk and a loaf of bread—mind you get it fresh and new—and,\n",
      "and—that's all, Mary.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, it's not all,\" said her husband. \"Thou must get sixpennyworth of rum, to warm the tea;\n",
      "thou'll get it at the 'Grapes.' And thou just go to Alice Wilson; he says she lives just right round\n",
      "the corner, under 14, Barber Street\" (this was addressed to his wife), \"and tell her to come and\n",
      "take her tea with us; she'll like to see her brother, I'll be bound, let alone Jane and the\n",
      "twins.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If she comes she must bring a tea-cup and saucer, for we have but half-a-dozen, and here's six\n",
      "of us,\" said Mrs. Barton.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Pooh! pooh! Jem and Mary can drink out of one, surely.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But Mary secretly determined to take care that Alice brought her tea-cup and saucer, if the\n",
      "alternative was to be her sharing any thing with Jem.</p>\n",
      "<p>Alice Wilson had but just come in. She had been out all day in the fields, gathering wild herbs\n",
      "for drinks and medicine, for in addition to her invaluable qualities as a sick nurse and her worldly\n",
      "occupation as a washerwoman, she added a considerable knowledge of hedge and field simples; and on\n",
      "fine days, when no more profitable occupation offered itself, she used to ramble off into the lanes\n",
      "and meadows as far as her legs could carry her. This evening she had returned loaded with nettles,\n",
      "and her first object was to light a candle and see to hang them up in bunches in every available\n",
      "place in her cellar room. It was the perfection of cleanliness: in one corner stood the\n",
      "modest-looking bed, with a check curtain at the head, the whitewashed wall filling up the place\n",
      "where the corresponding one should have been. The floor was bricked, and scrupulously clean,\n",
      "although so damp that it seemed as if the last washing would never dry up. As the cellar window\n",
      "looked into an area in the street, down which boys might throw stones, it was protected by an\n",
      "outside shelter, and was oddly festooned with all manner of hedge-row, ditch, and field plants,\n",
      "which we are accustomed to call valueless, but which have a powerful effect either for good or for\n",
      "evil, and are consequently much used among the poor. The room was strewed, hung, and darkened with\n",
      "these bunches, which emitted no very fragrant odour in their process of drying. In one corner was a\n",
      "sort of broad hanging shelf, made of old planks, where some old hoards of Alice's were kept. Her\n",
      "little bit of crockery ware was ranged on the mantelpiece, where also stood her candlestick and box\n",
      "of matches. A small cupboard contained at the bottom coals, and at the top her bread and basin of\n",
      "oatmeal, her frying pan, tea-pot, and a small tin saucepan, which served as a kettle, as well as for\n",
      "cooking the delicate little messes of broth which Alice sometimes was able to manufacture for a sick\n",
      "neighbour.</p>\n",
      "<p>After her walk she felt chilly and weary, and was busy trying to light her fire with the damp\n",
      "coals, and half green sticks, when Mary knocked.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come in,\" said Alice, remembering, however, that she had barred the door for the night, and\n",
      "hastening to make it possible for any one to come in.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is that you, Mary Barton?\" exclaimed she, as the light from her candle streamed on the girl's\n",
      "face. \"How you are grown since I used to see you at my brother's! Come in, lass, come in.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Please,\" said Mary, almost breathless, \"mother says you're to come to tea, and bring your cup\n",
      "and saucer, for George and Jane Wilson is with us, and the twins, and Jem. And you're to make haste,\n",
      "please.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm sure it's very neighbourly and kind in your mother, and I'll come, with many thanks. Stay,\n",
      "Mary, has your mother got any nettles for spring drink? If she hasn't I'll take her some.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, I don't think she has.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary ran off like a hare to fulfil what, to a girl of thirteen, fond of power, was the more\n",
      "interesting part of her errand—the money-spending part. And well and ably did she perform her\n",
      "business, returning home with a little bottle of rum, and the eggs in one hand, while her other was\n",
      "filled with some excellent red-and-white smoke-flavoured Cumberland ham, wrapped up in paper.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was at home, and frying ham, before Alice had chosen her nettles, put out her candle, locked\n",
      "her door, and walked in a very foot-sore manner as far as John Barton's. What an aspect of comfort\n",
      "did his houseplace present, after her humble cellar. She did not think of comparing; but for all\n",
      "that she felt the delicious glow of the fire, the bright light that revelled in every corner of the\n",
      "room, the savoury smells, the comfortable sounds of a boiling kettle, and the hissing, frizzling\n",
      "ham. With a little old-fashioned curtsey she shut the door, and replied with a loving heart to the\n",
      "boisterous and surprised greeting of her brother.</p>\n",
      "<p>And now all preparations being made, the party sat down; Mrs. Wilson in the post of honour, the\n",
      "rocking chair on the right hand side of the fire, nursing her baby, while its father, in an opposite\n",
      "arm-chair, tried vainly to quieten the other with bread soaked in milk.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Barton knew manners too well to do any thing but sit at the tea-table and make tea, though\n",
      "in her heart she longed to be able to superintend the frying of the ham, and cast many an anxious\n",
      "look at Mary as she broke the eggs and turned the ham, with a very comfortable portion of confidence\n",
      "in her own culinary powers. Jem stood awkwardly leaning against the dresser, replying rather gruffly\n",
      "to his aunt's speeches, which gave him, he thought, the air of being a little boy; whereas he\n",
      "considered himself as a young man, and not so very young neither, as in two months he would be\n",
      "eighteen. Barton vibrated between the fire and the tea-table, his only drawback being a fancy that\n",
      "every now and then his wife's face flushed and contracted as if in pain.</p>\n",
      "<p>At length the business actually began. Knives and forks, cups and saucers made a noise, but human\n",
      "voices were still, for human beings were hungry, and had no time to speak. Alice first broke\n",
      "silence; holding her tea-cup with the manner of one proposing a toast, she said, \"Here's to absent\n",
      "friends. Friends may meet, but mountains never.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It was an unlucky toast or sentiment, as she instantly felt. Every one thought of Esther, the\n",
      "absent Esther; and Mrs. Barton put down her food, and could not hide the fast dropping tears. Alice\n",
      "could have bitten her tongue out.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was a wet blanket to the evening; for though all had been said and suggested in the fields\n",
      "that could be said or suggested, every one had a wish to say something in the way of comfort to poor\n",
      "Mrs. Barton, and a dislike to talk about any thing else while her tears fell fast and scalding. So\n",
      "George Wilson, his wife and children, set off early home, not before (in spite of\n",
      "<hi>mal-à-propos</hi> speeches) they had expressed a wish that such meetings might often take place,\n",
      "and not before John Barton had given his hearty consent; and declared that as soon as ever his wife\n",
      "was well again they would have just such another evening.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I will take care not to come and spoil it,\" thought poor Alice; and going up to Mrs. Barton she\n",
      "took her hand almost humbly, and said, \"You don't know how sorry I am I said it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>To her surprise, a surprise that brought tears of joy into her eyes, Mary Barton put her arms\n",
      "round her neck, and kissed the self-reproaching Alice. \"You didn't mean any harm, and it was me as\n",
      "was so foolish; only this work about Esther, and not knowing where she is, lies so heavy on my\n",
      "heart. Good night, and never think no more about it. God bless you, Alice.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Many and many a time, as Alice reviewed that evening in her after life, did she bless Mary Barton\n",
      "for these kind and thoughtful words. But just then all she could say was, \"Good night, Mary, and may\n",

      "<p>In the middle of that same night a neighbour of the Bartons was roused from her sound,\n",
      "well-earned sleep, by a knocking, which had at first made part of her dream; but starting up, as\n",
      "soon as she became convinced of its reality, she opened the window, and asked who was there?</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Me, John Barton,\" answered he, in a voice tremulous with agitation. \"My missis is in labour,\n",
      "and, for the love of God, step in while I run for th' doctor, for she's fearful bad.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>While the woman hastily dressed herself, leaving the window still open, she heard cries of agony,\n",
      "which resounded in the little court in the stillness of the night. In less than five minutes she was\n",
      "standing by Mrs. Barton's bed-side, relieving the terrified Mary, who went about, where she was\n",
      "told, like an automaton; her eyes tearless, her face calm, though deadly pale, and uttering no\n",
      "sound, except when her teeth chattered for very nervousness.</p>\n",
      "<p>The cries grew worse.</p>\n",
      "<p>The doctor was very long in hearing the repeated rings at his night-bell, and still longer in\n",
      "understanding who it was that made this sudden call upon his services; and then he begged Barton\n",
      "just to wait while he dressed himself, in order that no time might be lost in finding the court and\n",
      "house. Barton absolutely stamped with impatience, outside the doctor's door, before he came down;\n",
      "and walked so fast homewards, that the medical man several times asked him to go slower.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is she so very bad?\" asked he.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Worse, much worser than ever I saw her before,\" replied John.</p>\n",
      "<p>No! she was not—she was at peace. The cries were still for ever. John had no time for listening.\n",
      "He opened the latched door, stayed not to light a candle for the mere ceremony of showing his\n",
      "companion up the stairs, so well known to himself; but, in two minutes was in the room, where lay\n",
      "the dead wife, whom he had loved with all the power of his strong heart. The doctor stumbled up\n",
      "stairs by the fire-light, and met the awe-struck look of the neighbour, which at once told him the\n",
      "state of things. The room was still, as he, with habitual tip-toe step, approached the poor frail\n",
      "body, whom nothing now could more disturb. Her daughter knelt by the bed-side, her face buried in\n",
      "the clothes, which were almost crammed into her mouth, to keep down the choking sobs. The husband\n",
      "stood like one stupified. The doctor questioned the neighbour in whispers, and then approaching\n",
      "Barton, said, \"You must go down stairs. This is a great shock, but bear it like a man. Go down.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He went mechanically and sat down on the first chair. He had no hope. The look of death was too\n",
      "clear upon her face. Still, when he heard one or two unusual noises, the thought burst on him that\n",
      "it might only be a trance, a fit, a—he did not well know what,—but not death! Oh, not death! And he\n",
      "was starting up to go up stairs again, when the doctor's heavy cautious creaking footstep was heard\n",
      "on the stairs. Then he knew what it really was in the chamber above.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nothing could have saved her—there has been some shock to the system—\" and so he went on; but,\n",
      "to unheeding ears, which yet retained his words to ponder on; words not for immediate use in\n",
      "conveying sense, but to be laid by, in the store-house of memory, for a more convenient season. The\n",
      "doctor seeing the state of the case, grieved for the man; and, very sleepy, thought it best to go,\n",
      "and accordingly wished him good-night—but there was no answer, so he let himself out; and Barton sat\n",
      "on, like a stock or a stone, so rigid, so still. He heard the sounds above too, and knew what they\n",
      "meant. He heard the stiff, unseasoned drawer, in which his wife kept her clothes, pulled open. He\n",
      "saw the neighbour come down, and blunder about in search of soap and water. He knew well what she\n",
      "wanted, and <hi>why</hi> she wanted them, but he did not speak, nor offer to help. At last she went,\n",
      "with some kindly-meant words (a text of comfort, which fell upon a deafened ear), and something\n",
      "about \"Mary,\" but which Mary, in his bewildered state, he could not tell.</p>\n",
      "<p>He tried to realise it, to think it possible. And then his mind wandered off to other days, to\n",
      "far different times. He thought of their courtship; of his first seeing her, an awkward, beautiful\n",
      "rustic, far too shiftless for the delicate factory work to which she was apprenticed; of his first\n",
      "gift to her, a bead necklace, which had long ago been put by, in one of the deep drawers of the\n",
      "dresser, to be kept for Mary. He wondered if it was there yet, and with a strange curiosity he got\n",
      "up to feel for it; for the fire by this time was well-nigh out, and candle he had none. His groping\n",
      "hand fell on the piled-up tea things, which at his desire she had left unwashed till morning—they\n",
      "were all so tired. He was reminded of one of the daily little actions, which acquire such power when\n",
      "they have been performed for the last time, by one we love. He began to think over his wife's daily\n",
      "round of duties; and something in the remembrance that these would never more be done by her,\n",
      "touched the source of tears, and he cried aloud. Poor Mary, meanwhile, had mechanically helped the\n",
      "neighbour in all the last attentions to the dead; and when she was kissed, and spoken to soothingly,\n",
      "tears stole quietly down her cheeks: but she reserved the luxury of a full burst of grief till she\n",
      "should be alone. She shut the chamber-door softly, after the neighbour had gone, and then shook the\n",
      "bed by which she knelt, with her agony of sorrow. She repeated, over and over again, the same words;\n",
      "the same vain, unanswered address to her who was no more. \"Oh, mother! mother, are you really dead!\n",
      "Oh, mother, mother!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>At last she stopped, because it flashed across her mind that her violence of grief might disturb\n",
      "her father. All was still below. She looked on the face so changed, and yet so strangely like. She\n",
      "bent down to kiss it. The cold, unyielding flesh struck a shudder to her heart, and, hastily obeying\n",
      "her impulse, she grasped the candle, and opened the door. Then she heard the sobs of her father's\n",
      "grief; and quickly, quietly, stealing down the steps, she knelt by him, and kissed his hand. He took\n",
      "no notice at first, for his burst of grief would not be controlled. But when her shriller sobs, her\n",
      "terrified cries (which she could not repress), rose upon his ear, he checked himself.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Child, we must be all to one another, now <hi>she</hi> is gone,\" whispered he.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, father, what can I do for you? Do tell me! I'll do any thing.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I know thou wilt. Thou must not fret thyself ill, that's the first thing I ask. Thou must leave\n",
      "me, and go to bed now, like a good girl as thou art.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Leave you, father! oh, don't say so.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, but thou must! thou must go to bed, and try and sleep; thou'lt have enough to do and to\n",
      "bear, poor wench, to-morrow.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary got up, kissed her father, and sadly went up stairs to the little closet, where she slept.\n",
      "She thought it was of no use undressing, for that she could never, never sleep, so threw herself on\n",
      "her bed in her clothes, and before ten minutes had passed away, the passionate grief of youth had\n",
      "subsided into sleep.</p>\n",
      "<p>Barton had been roused by his daughter's entrance, both from his stupor and from his\n",
      "uncontrollable sorrow. He could think on what was to be done, could plan for the funeral, could\n",
      "calculate the necessity of soon returning to his work, as the extravagance of the past night would\n",
      "leave them short of money, if he long remained away from the mill. He was in a club, so that money\n",
      "was provided for the burial. These things settled in his own mind, he recalled the doctor's words,\n",
      "and bitterly thought of the shock his poor wife had so recently had, in the mysterious disappearance\n",
      "of her cherished sister. His feelings towards Esther almost amounted to curses. It was she who had\n",
      "brought on all this sorrow. Her giddiness, her lightness of conduct, had wrought this woe. His\n",
      "previous thoughts about her had been tinged with wonder and pity, but now he hardened his heart\n",
      "against her for ever.</p>\n",
      "<p>One of the good influences over John Barton's life had departed that night. One of the ties which\n",
      "bound him down to the gentle humanities of earth was loosened, and henceforward the neighbours all\n",
      "remarked he was a changed man. His gloom and his sternness became habitual instead of occasional. He\n",
      "was more obstinate. But never to Mary. Between the father and the daughter there existed in full\n",
      "force that mysterious bond which unites those who have been loved by one who is now dead and gone.\n",
      "While he was harsh and silent to others, he humoured Mary with tender love; she had more of her own\n",
      "way than is common in any rank with girls of her age. Part of this was the necessity of the case;\n",
      "for, of course, all the money went through her hands, and the household arrangements were guided by\n",
      "her will and pleasure. But part was her father's indulgence, for he left her, with full trust in her\n",
      "unusual sense and spirit, to choose her own associates, and her own times for seeing them.</p>\n",
      "<p>With all this, Mary had not her father's confidence in the matters which now began to occupy him,\n",
      "heart and soul; she was aware that he had joined clubs, and become an active member of a trades'\n",
      "union, but it was hardly likely that a girl of Mary's age (even when two or three years had elapsed\n",
      "since her mother's death) should care much for the differences between the employers and the\n",
      "employed,—an eternal subject for agitation in the manufacturing districts, which, however it may be\n",
      "lulled for a time, is sure to break forth again with fresh violence at any depression of trade,\n",
      "showing that in its apparent quiet, the ashes had still smouldered in the breasts of a few.</p>\n",
      "<p>Among these few was John Barton. At all times it is a bewildering thing to the poor weaver to see\n",
      "his employer removing from house to house, each one grander than the last, till he ends in building\n",
      "one more magnificent than all, or withdraws his money from the concern, or sells his mill to buy an\n",
      "estate in the country, while all the time the weaver, who thinks he and his fellows are the real\n",
      "makers of this wealth, is struggling on for bread for their children, through the vicissitudes of\n",
      "lowered wages, short hours, fewer hands employed, &amp;c. And when he knows trade is bad, and could\n",
      "understand (at least partially) that there are not buyers enough in the market to purchase the goods\n",
      "already made, and consequently that there is no demand for more; when he would bear and endure much\n",
      "without complaining, could he also see that his employers were bearing their share; he is, I say,\n",
      "bewildered and (to use his own word) \"aggravated\" to see that all goes on just as usual with the\n",
      "mill-owners. Large houses are still occupied, while spinners' and weavers' cottages stand empty,\n",
      "because the families that once occupied them are obliged to live in rooms or cellars. Carriages\n",
      "still roll along the streets, concerts are still crowded by subscribers, the shops for expensive\n",
      "luxuries still find daily customers, while the workman loiters away his unemployed time in watching\n",
      "these things, and thinking of the pale, uncomplaining wife at home, and the wailing children asking\n",
      "in vain for enough of food, of the sinking health, of the dying life of those near and dear to him.\n",
      "The contrast is too great. Why should he alone suffer from bad times?</p>\n",
      "<p>I know that this is not really the case; and I know what is the truth in such matters: but what I\n",
      "wish to impress is what the workman feels and thinks. True, that with child-like improvidence, good\n",
      "times will often dissipate his grumbling, and make him forget all prudence and foresight.</p>\n",
      "<p>But there are earnest men among these people, men who have endured wrongs without complaining,\n",
      "but without ever forgetting or forgiving those whom (they believe) have caused all this woe.</p>\n",
      "<p>Among these was John Barton. His parents had suffered, his mother had died from absolute want of\n",
      "the necessaries of life. He himself was a good, steady workman, and, as such, pretty certain of\n",
      "steady employment. But he spent all he got with the confidence (you may also call it improvidence)\n",
      "of one who was willing, and believed himself able, to supply all his wants by his own exertions. And\n",
      "when his master suddenly failed, and all hands in that mill were turned back, one Tuesday morning,\n",
      "with the news that Mr. Hunter had stopped, Barton had only a few shillings to rely on; but he had\n",
      "good heart of being employed at some other mill, and accordingly, before returning home, he spent\n",
      "some hours in going from factory to factory, asking for work. But at every mill was some sign of\n",
      "depression of trade; some were working short hours, some were turning off hands, and for weeks\n",
      "Barton was out of work, living on credit. It was during this time his little son, the apple of his\n",
      "eye, the cynosure of all his strong power of love, fell ill of the scarlet fever. They dragged him\n",
      "through the crisis, but his life hung on a gossamer thread. Every thing, the doctor said, depended\n",
      "on good nourishment, on generous living, to keep up the little fellow's strength, in the prostration\n",
      "in which the fever had left him. Mocking words! when the commonest food in the house would not\n",
      "furnish one little meal. Barton tried credit; but it was worn out at the little provision shops,\n",
      "which were now suffering in their turn. He thought it would be no sin to steal, and would have\n",
      "stolen; but he could not get the opportunity in the few days the child lingered. Hungry himself,\n",
      "almost to an animal pitch of ravenousness, but with the bodily pain swallowed up in anxiety for his\n",
      "little sinking lad, he stood at one of the shop windows where all edible luxuries are displayed;\n",
      "haunches of venison, Stilton cheeses, moulds of jelly—all appetising sights to the common passer by.\n",
      "And out of this shop came Mrs. Hunter! She crossed to her carriage, followed by the shopman loaded\n",
      "with purchases for a party. The door was quickly slammed to, and she drove away; and Barton returned\n",
      "home with a bitter spirit of wrath in his heart, to see his only boy a corpse!</p>\n",
      "<p>You can fancy, now, the hoards of vengeance in his heart against the employers. For there are\n",
      "never wanting those who, either in speech or in print, find it their interest to cherish such\n",
      "feelings in the working classes; who know how and when to rouse the dangerous power at their\n",
      "command; and who use their knowledge with unrelenting purpose to either party.</p>\n",
      "<p>So while Mary took her own way, growing more spirited every day, and growing in her beauty too,\n",
      "her father was chairman at many a trades' union meeting; a friend of delegates, and ambitious of\n",
      "being a delegate himself; a Chartist, and ready to do any thing for his order.</p>\n",
      "<p>But now times were good; and all these feelings were theoretical, not practical. His most\n",
      "practical thought was getting Mary apprenticed to a dressmaker; for he had never left off disliking\n",
      "a factory life for a girl, on more accounts than one.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary must do something. The factories being, as I said, out of the question, there were two\n",
      "things open—going out to service, and the dressmaking business; and against the first of these, Mary\n",
      "set herself with all the force of her strong will. What that will might have been able to achieve\n",
      "had her father been against her, I cannot tell; but he disliked the idea of parting with her, who\n",
      "was the light of his hearth, the voice of his otherwise silent home. Besides, with his ideas and\n",
      "feelings towards the higher classes, he considered domestic servitude as a species of slavery; a\n",
      "pampering of artificial wants on the one side, a giving-up of every right of leisure by day and\n",
      "quiet rest by night on the other. How far his strong exaggerated feelings had any foundation in\n",
      "truth, it is for you to judge. I am afraid that Mary's determination not to go to service arose from\n",

      "shawl or large handkerchief, pinned down behind and at the sides in front. The old woman gave her a\n",
      "hearty greeting, and made her sit down on the chair she had just left, while she balanced herself on\n",

      "sure; no, they knew each other too well. But Mary liked making an impression, and in this it must be\n",
      "owned she was pretty often gratified—and there was this strange girl to consider just now. So she\n",
      "put on her pretty new blue merino, made tight to her throat, her little linen collar and linen\n",

      "nothing of the plant; but stated, that if any one could give him the desired information, it would\n",

      "<p>\"Oh, yes,\" replied the man. \"He does a bit in my way;\" and, on further investigation, it turned\n",

      "a jerking motion, as if his limbs were worked by a string like a child's toy, with dun coloured hair\n",
      "lying thin and soft at the back and sides of his head; his forehead was so large it seemed to\n",
      "overbalance the rest of his face, which had indeed lost its natural contour by the absence of all\n",
      "the teeth. The eyes absolutely gleamed with intelligence; so keen, so observant, you felt as if they\n",
      "were almost wizard-like. Indeed, the whole room looked not unlike a wizard's dwelling. Instead of\n",
      "pictures were hung rude wooden frames of impaled insects; the little table was covered with\n",

      "<p>On her appearance he pushed his spectacles up so as to rest midway on his forehead, and gave Mary\n",
      "a short, kind welcome. But Margaret he caressed as a mother caresses her first-born; stroking her\n",
      "with tenderness, and almost altering his voice as he spoke to her.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary looked round on the odd, strange things she had never seen at home, and which seemed to her\n",
      "to have a very uncanny look.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is your grandfather a fortune-teller?\" whispered she to her new friend.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No,\" replied Margaret, in the same voice; \"but you're not the first as has taken him for such.\n",
      "He is only fond of such things as most folks know nothing about.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And do you know aught about them, too?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I know a bit about some of the things grandfather is fond on; just because he's fond on 'em I\n",

      "<p>\"What things are these?\" said Mary, struck with the weird looking creatures that sprawled around\n",
      "the room in their roughly-made glass cases.</p>\n",
      "<p>But she was not prepared for the technical names which Job Legh pattered down on her ear, on\n",
      "which they fell like hail on a skylight; and the strange language only bewildered her more than\n",
      "ever. Margaret saw the state of the case, and came to the rescue.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Look, Mary, at this horrid scorpion. He gave me such a fright: I'm all of a twitter yet when I\n",
      "think of it. Grandfather went to Liverpool one Whitsun-week to go strolling about the docks and pick\n",
      "up what he could from the sailors, who often bring some queer thing or another from the hot\n",
      "countries they go to; and so he sees a chap with a bottle in his hand, like a druggist's\n",
      "physic-bottle; and says grandfather, 'What have ye gotten there?' So the sailor holds it up, and\n",
      "grandfather knew it was a rare kind o' scorpion, not common even in the East Indies where the man\n",
      "came from; and says he, 'How did ye catch this fine fellow, for he wouldn't be taken for nothing I'm\n",
      "thinking?' And the man said as how when they were unloading the ship he'd found him lying behind a\n",
      "bag of rice, and he thought the cold had killed him, for he was not squashed nor injured a bit. He\n",
      "did not like to part with any of the spirit out of his grog to put the scorpion in, but slipped him\n",
      "into the bottle, knowing there were folks enow who would give him something for him. So grandfather\n",
      "gives him a shilling.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Two shilling,\" interrupted Job Legh, \"and a good bargain it was.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well! grandfather came home as proud as Punch, and pulled the bottle out of his pocket. But you\n",
      "see th' scorpion were doubled up, and grandfather thought I couldn't fairly see how big he was. So\n",
      "he shakes him out right before the fire; and a good warm one it was, for I was ironing, I remember.\n",
      "I left off ironing, and stooped down over him, to look at him better, and grandfather got a book,\n",
      "and began to read how this very kind were the most poisonous and vicious species, how their bite\n",
      "were often fatal, and then went on to read how people who were bitten got swelled, and screamed with\n",
      "pain. I was listening hard, but as it fell out, I never took my eyes off the creature, though I\n",
      "could not ha' told I was watching it. Suddenly it seemed to give a jerk, and before I could speak,\n",
      "it gave another, and in a minute it was as wild as could be, running at me just like a mad dog.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What did you do?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Me! why, I jumped first on a chair, and then on all the things I'd been ironing on the dresser,\n",
      "and I screamed for grandfather to come up by me, but he did not hearken to me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, if I'd come up by thee, who'd ha' caught the creature, I should like to know?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, I begged grandfather to crush it, and I had the iron right over it once, ready to drop,\n",
      "but grandfather begged me not to hurt it in that way. So I couldn't think what he'd have, for he\n",
      "hopped round the room as if he were sore afraid, for all he begged me not to injure it. At last he\n",
      "goes to th' kettle, and lifts up the lid, and peeps in. What on earth is he doing that for, thinks\n",
      "I; he'll never drink his tea with a scorpion running free and easy about the room. Then he takes the\n",
      "tongs, and he settles his spectacles on his nose, and in a minute he had lifted the creature up by\n",
      "th' leg, and dropped him into the boiling water.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And did that kill him?\" said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, sure enough; he boiled for longer time than grandfather liked though. But I was so afeard of\n",
      "his coming round again. I ran to the public-house for some gin, and grandfather filled the bottle,\n",
      "and then we poured off the water, and picked him out of the kettle, and dropped him into the bottle,\n",
      "and he were there above a twelvemonth.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What brought him to life at first?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, you see, he were never really dead, only torpid—that is, dead asleep with the cold, and our\n",
      "good fire brought him round.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm glad father does not care for such things,\" said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Are you! Well, I'm often downright glad grandfather is so fond of his books, and his creatures,\n",
      "and his plants. It does my heart good to see him so happy, sorting them all at home, and so ready to\n",
      "go in search of more, whenever he's a spare day. Look at him now! he's gone back to his books, and\n",
      "he'll be as happy as a king, working away till I make him go to bed. It keeps him silent, to be\n",
      "sure; but so long as I see him earnest, and pleased, and eager, what does that matter? Then, when he\n",
      "has his talking bouts, you can't think how much he has to say. Dear grandfather! you don't know how\n",
      "happy we are!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary wondered if the dear grandfather heard all this, for Margaret did not speak in an under\n",
      "tone; but no! he was far too deep and eager in solving a problem. He did not even notice Mary's\n",
      "leave-taking, and she went home with the feeling that she had that night made the acquaintance of\n",
      "two of the strangest people she ever saw in her life. Margaret, so quiet, so common place, until her\n",
      "singing powers were called forth; so silent from home, so cheerful and agreeable at home; and her\n",
      "grandfather so very different to any one Mary had ever seen. Margaret had said he was not a\n",
      "fortune-teller, but she did not know whether to believe her.</p>\n",
      "<p>To resolve her doubts, she told the history of the evening to her father, who was interested by\n",
      "her account, and curious to see and judge for himself. Opportunities are not often wanting where\n",
      "inclination goes before, and ere the end of that winter Mary looked upon Margaret almost as an old\n",
      "friend. The latter would bring her work when Mary was likely to be at home in the evenings and sit\n",
      "with her; and Job Legh would put a book and his pipe in his pocket and just step round the corner to\n",
      "fetch his grand-child, ready for a talk if he found Barton in; ready to pull out pipe and book if\n",
      "the girls wanted him to wait, and John was still at his club. In short, ready to do whatever would\n",
      "give pleasure to his darling Margaret.</p>\n",
      "<p>I do not know what points of resemblance (or dissimilitude, for the one joins people as often as\n",
      "the other) attracted the two girls to each other. Margaret had the great charm of possessing good\n",
      "strong common sense, and do you not perceive how involuntarily this is valued? It is so pleasant to\n",
      "have a friend who possesses the power of setting a difficult question in a clear light; whose\n",
      "judgment can tell what is best to be done; and who is so convinced of what is \"wisest, best,\" that\n",
      "in consideration of the end, all difficulties in the way diminish. People admire talent, and talk\n",
      "about their admiration. But they value common sense without talking about it, and often without\n",
      "knowing it.</p>\n",
      "<p>So Mary and Margaret grew in love one toward the other; and Mary told many of her feelings in a\n",
      "way she had never done before to any one. Most of her foibles also were made known to Margaret, but\n",
      "not all. There was one cherished weakness still concealed from every one. It concerned a lover, not\n",
      "beloved, but favoured by fancy. A gallant, handsome young man; but—not beloved. Yet Mary hoped to\n",
      "meet him every day in her walks, blushed when she heard his name, and tried to think of him as her\n",
      "future husband, and above all, tried to think of herself as his future wife. Alas! poor Mary! Bitter\n",
      "woe did thy weakness work thee.</p>\n",
      "<p>She had other lovers. One or two would gladly have kept her company, but she held herself too\n",
      "high, they said. Jem Wilson said nothing, but loved on and on, ever more fondly; he hoped against\n",
      "hope; he would not give up, for it seemed like giving up life to give up thought of Mary. He did not\n",
      "dare to look to any end of all this; the present, so that he saw her, touched the hem of her\n",
      "garment, was enough. Surely, in time, such deep love would beget love.</p>\n",
      "<p>He would not relinquish hope, and yet her coldness of manner was enough to daunt any man; and it\n",
      "made Jem more despairing than he would acknowledge for a long time even to himself.</p>\n",
      "<p>But one evening he came round by Barton's house, a willing messenger for his father, and opening\n",
      "the door saw Margaret sitting asleep before the fire. She had come in to speak to Mary; and worn out\n",
      "by a long working, watching night, she fell asleep in the genial warmth.</p>\n",
      "<p>An old-fashioned saying about a pair of gloves came into Jem's mind, and stepping gently up he\n",
      "kissed Margaret with a friendly kiss.</p>\n",
      "<p>She awoke, and perfectly understanding the thing, she said, \"For shame of yourself, Jem! What\n",
      "would Mary say?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Lightly said, lightly answered.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She'd nobbut say, practice makes perfect.\" And they both laughed. But the words Margaret had\n",
      "said rankled in Jem's mind. Would Mary care? Would she care in the very least? They seemed to call\n",
      "for an answer by night, and by day; and Jem felt that his heart told him Mary was quite indifferent\n",
      "to any action of his. Still he loved on, and on, ever more fondly.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary's father was well aware of the nature of Jem Wilson's feelings for his daughter, but he took\n",
      "no notice of them to any one, thinking Mary full young yet for the cares of married life, and\n",
      "unwilling, too, to entertain the idea of parting with her at any time, however distant. But he\n",
      "welcomed Jem at his house, as he would have done his father's son, whatever were his motives for\n",
      "coming; and now and then admitted the thought, that Mary might do worse when her time came, than\n",
      "marry Jem Wilson, a steady workman at a good trade, a good son to his parents, and a fine manly\n",
      "spirited chap—at least when Mary was not by: for when she was present he watched her too closely,\n",
      "and too anxiously, to have much of what John Barton called \"spunk\" in him.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was towards the end of February, in that year, and a bitter black frost had lasted for many\n",
      "weeks. The keen east wind had long since swept the streets clean, though on a gusty day the dust\n",
      "would rise like pounded ice, and make people's faces quite smart with the cold force with which it\n",
      "blew against them. Houses, sky, people, and every thing looked as if a gigantic brush had washed\n",
      "them all over with a dark shade of Indian ink. There was some reason for this grimy appearance on\n",
      "human beings, whatever there might be for the dun looks of the landscape; for soft water had become\n",
      "an article not even to be purchased; and the poor washerwomen might be seen vainly trying to procure\n",
      "a little by breaking the thick gray ice that coated the ditches and ponds in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "People prophesied a long continuance to this already lengthened frost; said the spring would be very\n",
      "late; no spring fashions required; no summer clothing purchased for a short uncertain summer. Indeed\n",
      "there was no end to the evil prophesied during the continuance of that bleak east wind.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary hurried home one evening, just as daylight was fading, from Miss Simmonds', with her shawl\n",
      "held up to her mouth, and her head bent as if in deprecation of the meeting wind. So she did not\n",
      "perceive Margaret till, she was close upon her at the very turning into the court.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Bless me, Margaret! is that you? Where are you bound to?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To nowhere but your own house (that is, if you'll take me in). I've a job of work to finish\n",
      "to-night; mourning, as must be in time for the funeral to-morrow; and grandfather has been out\n",

      "above a bit behindhand. I've the skirts all to make. I kept that work till candlelight; and the\n",

      "<p>By this time Mary had broken up the raking coal, and lighted her candle; and Margaret settled\n",
      "herself to her work on one side of the table, while her friend hurried over her tea at the other.\n",
      "The things were then lifted <hi>en masse</hi> to the dresser; and dusting her side of the table with\n",
      "the apron she always wore at home, Mary took up some breadths and began to run them together.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Who's it all for, for if you told me I've forgotten?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why for Mrs. Ogden as keeps the greengrocer's shop in Oxford Road. Her husband drank himself to\n",
      "death, and though she cried over him and his ways all the time he was alive, she's fretted sadly for\n",
      "him now he's dead.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Has he left her much to go upon?\" asked Mary, examining the texture of the dress. \"This is\n",
      "beautifully fine soft bombazine.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, I'm much afeared there's but little, and there's several young children, besides the three\n",

      "<p>\"So I dare say they do, many a one, but now they seem all so busy getting ready for the funeral;\n",
      "for it's to be quite a grand affair, well-nigh twenty people to breakfast, as one of the little ones\n",
      "told me; the little thing seemed to like the fuss, and I do believe it comforted poor Mrs. Ogden to\n",
      "make all the piece o' work. Such a smell of ham boiling and fowls roasting while I waited in the\n",
      "kitchen; it seemed more like a wedding nor <ref target=\"#footnote7\">[7]</ref> a funeral. They said\n",
      "she'd spend a matter o' sixty pound on th' burial.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I thought you said she was but badly off,\" said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, I know she's asked for credit at several places, saying her husband laid hands on every\n",
      "farthing he could get for drink. But th' undertakers urge her on you see, and tell her this thing's\n",
      "usual, and that thing's only a common mark of respect, and that every body has t'other thing, till\n",
      "the poor woman has no will o' her own. I dare say, too, her heart strikes her (it always does when a\n",
      "person's gone) for many a word and many a slighting deed to him, who's stiff and cold; and she\n",
      "thinks to make up matters, as it were, by a grand funeral, though she and all her children, too, may\n",
      "have to pinch many a year to pay the expenses, if ever they pay them at all.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"This mourning, too, will cost a pretty penny,\" said Mary. \"I often wonder why folks wear\n",
      "mourning; it's not pretty or becoming; and it costs a deal of money just when people can spare it\n",
      "least; and if what the Bible tells us be true, we ought not to be sorry when a friend, who's been\n",
      "good, goes to his rest; and as for a bad man, one's glad enough to get shut <ref target=\"#footnote8\"\n",

      "<p>\"I'll tell you what I think th' fancy was sent for (Old Alice calls every thing 'sent for,' and I\n",
      "believe she's right). It does do good, though not as much as it costs, that I do believe, in setting\n",
      "people (as is cast down by sorrow and feels themselves unable to settle to any thing but crying)\n",
      "something to do. Why now I told you how they were grieving; for, perhaps, he was a kind husband and\n",
      "father, in his thoughtless way, when he wasn't in liquor. But they cheered up wonderful while I was\n",
      "there, and I asked 'em for more directions than usual, that they might have something to talk over\n",
      "and fix about; and I left 'em my fashion-book (though it were two months old) just a purpose.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't think every one would grieve a that way. Old Alice wouldn't.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Old Alice is one in a thousand. I doubt, too, if she would fret much, however sorry she might\n",
      "be. She would say it were sent, and fall to trying to find out what good it were to do. Every sorrow\n",
      "in her mind is sent for good. Did I ever tell you, Mary, what she said one day when she found me\n",
      "taking on about something?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No; do tell me. What were you fretting about, first place?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I can't tell you just now; perhaps I may sometime.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Perhaps this very evening, if it rises in my heart; perhaps never. It's a fear that sometimes I\n",
      "can't abide to think about, and sometimes I don't like to think on any thing else. Well, I was\n",
      "fretting about this fear, and Alice comes in for something, and finds me crying. I would not tell\n",
      "her no more than I would you, Mary; so she says, 'Well, dear, you must mind this, when you're going\n",
      "to fret and be low about any thing, \"An anxious mind is never a holy mind.\"' Oh, Mary, I have so\n",
      "often checked my grumbling sin' <ref target=\"#footnote9\">[9]</ref> she said that.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The weary sound of stitching was the only sound heard for a little while, till Mary inquired,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Do you expect to get paid for this mourning?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why I do not much think I shall. I've thought it over once or twice, and I mean to bring myself\n",
      "to think I shan't, and to like to do it as my bit towards comforting them. I don't think they can\n",
      "pay, and yet they're just the sort of folk to have their minds easier for wearing mourning. There's\n",
      "only one thing I dislike making black for, it does so hurt the eyes.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret put down her work with a sigh, and shaded her eyes. Then she assumed a cheerful tone,\n",

      "sometimes think I'm growing a little blind, and then what would become of grandfather and me? Oh,\n",
      "God help me, Lord help me!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She fell into an agony of tears, while Mary knelt by her, striving to soothe and to comfort her;\n",
      "but, like an inexperienced person, striving rather to deny the correctness of Margaret's fear, than\n",
      "helping her to meet and overcome the evil.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No,\" said Margaret, quietly fixing her tearful eyes on Mary; \"I know I'm not mistaken. I have\n",
      "felt one going some time, long before I ever thought what it would lead to; and last autumn I went\n",
      "to a doctor; and he did not mince the matter, but said unless I sat in a darkened room, with my\n",
      "hands before me, my sight would not last me many years longer. But how could I do that, Mary? For\n",
      "one thing, grandfather would have known there was somewhat the matter; and, oh! it will grieve him\n",
      "sore whenever he's told, so the later the better; and besides, Mary, we've sometimes little enough\n",
      "to go upon, and what I earn is a great help. For grandfather takes a day here, and a day there, for\n",
      "botanising or going after insects, and he'll think little enough of four or five shillings for a\n",
      "specimen; dear grandfather! and I'm so loath to think he should be stinted of what gives him such\n",
      "pleasure. So I went to another doctor to try and get him to say something different, and he said,\n",
      "'Oh, it was only weakness,' and gived me a bottle of lotion; but I've used three bottles (and each\n",
      "of 'em cost two shillings), and my eye is so much worse, not hurting so much, but I can't see a bit\n",
      "with it. There now, Mary,\" continued she, shutting one eye, \"now you only look like a great black\n",
      "shadow, with the edges dancing and sparkling.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And can you see pretty well with th' other?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, pretty near as well as ever. Th' only difference is, that if I sew a long time together, a\n",
      "bright spot like th' sun comes right where I'm looking; all the rest is quite clear but just where I\n",
      "want to see. I've been to both doctors again, and now they're both o' the same story; and I suppose\n",
      "I'm going dark as fast as may be. Plain work pays so bad, and mourning has been so plentiful this\n",
      "winter, I were tempted to take in any black work I could; and now I'm suffering from it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And yet, Margaret, you're going on taking it in; that's what you'd call foolish in another.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It is, Mary! and yet what can I do? Folk mun live; and I think I should go blind any way, and I\n",
      "darn't tell grandfather, else I would leave it off, but he will so fret.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret rocked herself backward and forward to still her emotion.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh Mary!\" she said, \"I try to get his face off by heart, and I stare at him so when he's not\n",
      "looking, and then shut my eyes to see if I can remember his dear face. There's one thing, Mary, that\n",
      "serves a bit to comfort me. You'll have heard of old Jacob Butterworth, the singing weaver? Well, I\n",
      "know'd him a bit, so I went to him, and said how I wished he'd teach me the right way o' singing;\n",
      "and he says I've a rare fine voice, and I go once a week, and take a lesson fra' him. He's been a\n",
      "grand singer in his day. He's led th' chorusses at the Festivals, and got thanked many a time by\n",
      "London folk; and one foreign singer, Madame Catalani, turned round and shook him by th' hand before\n",
      "the Oud Church <ref target=\"#footnote10\">[10]</ref> full o' people. He says I may gain ever so much\n",
      "money by singing; but I don't know. Any rate it's sad work, being blind.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She took up her sewing, saying her eyes were rested now, and for some time they sewed on in\n",
      "silence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly there were steps heard in the little paved court; person after person ran past the\n",
      "curtained window.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Something's up,\" said Mary. She went to the door and stopping the first person she saw, inquired\n",
      "the cause of the commotion.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Eh, wench! donna ye see the fire-light? Carsons' mill is blazing away like fun;\" and away her\n",
      "informant ran.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come, Margaret, on wi' your bonnet, and let's go to see Carsons' mill; it's afire, and they say\n",
      "a burning mill is such a grand sight. I never saw one.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, I think it's a fearful sight. Besides I've all this work to do.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But Mary coaxed in her sweet manner, and with her gentle caresses, promising to help with the\n",
      "gowns all night long if necessary, nay, saying she should quite enjoy it.</p>\n",
      "<p>The truth was, Margaret's secret weighed heavily and painfully on her mind, and she felt her\n",
      "inability to comfort; besides, she wanted to change the current of Margaret's thoughts; and in\n",
      "addition to these unselfish feelings, came the desire she had honestly expressed, of seeing a\n",
      "factory on fire.</p>\n",
      "<p>So in two minutes they were ready. At the threshold of the house they met John Barton, to whom\n",
      "they told their errand.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Carsons' mill! Ay, there is a mill on fire somewhere, sure enough, by the light, and it will be\n",
      "a rare blaze, for there's not a drop o' water to be got. And much Carsons will care, for they're\n",
      "well insured, and the machines are a' th' oud-fashioned kind. See if they don't think it a fine\n",
      "thing for themselves. They'll not thank them as tries to put it out.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He gave way for the impatient girls to pass. Guided by the ruddy light more than by any exact\n",
      "knowledge of the streets that led to the mill, they scampered along with bent heads, facing the\n",
      "terrible east wind as best they might.</p>\n",
      "<p>Carsons' mill ran lengthways from east to west. Along it went one of the oldest thoroughfares in\n",
      "Manchester. Indeed all that part of the town was comparatively old; it was there that the first\n",
      "cotton mills were built, and the crowded alleys and back streets of the neighbourhood made a fire\n",
      "there particularly to be dreaded. The staircase of the mill ascended from the entrance at the\n",
      "western end, which faced into a wide dingy-looking street, consisting principally of public-houses,\n",
      "pawn-brokers' shops, rag and bone warehouses, and dirty provision shops. The other, the east end of\n",
      "the factory, fronted into a very narrow back street, not twenty feet wide, and miserably lighted and\n",
      "paved. Right against this end of the factory were the gable ends of the last house in the principal\n",
      "street—a house which from its size, its handsome stone facings, and the attempt at ornament in the\n",
      "front, had probably been once a gentleman's house; but now the light which streamed from its\n",
      "enlarged front windows made clear the interior of the splendidly fitted up room, with its painted\n",
      "walls, its pillared recesses, its gilded and gorgeous fittings up, its miserable, squalid inmates.\n",
      "It was a gin palace.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary almost wished herself away, so fearful (as Margaret had said) was the sight when they joined\n",
      "the crowd assembled to witness the fire. There was a murmur of many voices whenever the roaring of\n",
      "the flames ceased for an instant. It was easy to perceive the mass were deeply interested.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What do they say?\" asked Margaret, of a neighbour in the crowd, as she caught a few words, clear\n",
      "and distinct, from the general murmur.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"There never is anyone in the mill, surely!\" exclaimed Mary, as the sea of upward-turned faces\n",
      "moved with one accord to the eastern end, looking into Dunham Street, the narrow back lane already\n",
      "mentioned.</p>\n",
      "<p>The western end of the mill, whither the raging flames were driven by the wind, was crowned and\n",
      "turreted with triumphant fire. It sent forth its infernal tongues from every window hole, licking\n",
      "the black walls with amorous fierceness; it was swayed or fell before the mighty gale, only to rise\n",
      "higher and yet higher, to ravage and roar yet more wildly. This part of the roof fell in with an\n",
      "astounding crash, while the crowd struggled more and more to press into Dunham Street, for what were\n",
      "magnificent terrible flames, what were falling timbers or tottering walls, in comparison with human\n",
      "life?</p>\n",
      "<p>There, where the devouring flames had been repelled by the yet more powerful wind, but where yet\n",
      "black smoke gushed out from every aperture, there, at one of the windows on the fourth story, or\n",
      "rather a doorway where a crane was fixed to hoist up goods, might occasionally be seen, when the\n",
      "thick gusts of smoke cleared partially away for an instant, the imploring figures of two men. They\n",
      "had remained after the rest of the workmen for some reason or other, and, owing to the wind having\n",
      "driven the fire in the opposite direction, had perceived no sight or sound of alarm, till long after\n",
      "(if any thing could be called long in that throng of terrors which passed by in less time than half\n",
      "an hour) the fire had consumed the old wooden staircase at the other end of the building. I am not\n",
      "sure whether it was not the first sound of the rushing crowd below that made them fully aware of\n",
      "their awful position.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where are the engines?\" asked Margaret of her neighbour.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They're coming, no doubt; but, bless you, I think it's bare ten minutes since we first found out\n",
      "th' fire; it rages so wi' this wind, and all so dry-like.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is no one gone for a ladder?\" gasped Mary, as the men were perceptibly, though not audibly,\n",
      "praying the great multitude below for help.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, Wilson's son and another man were off like a shot, well nigh five minute agone. But th'\n",
      "masons, and slaters, and such like, have left their work, and locked up the yards.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Wilson! then, was that man whose figure loomed out against the ever increasing dull hot light\n",
      "behind, whenever the smoke was clear,—was that George Wilson? Mary sickened with terror. She knew he\n",
      "worked for Carsons; but at first she had had no idea any lives were in danger; and since she had\n",
      "become aware of this, the heated air, the roaring flames, the dizzy light, and the agitated and\n",
      "murmuring crowd, had bewildered her thoughts.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! let us go home, Margaret; I cannot stay.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"We cannot go! See how we are wedged in by folks. Poor Mary! ye won't hanker after a fire again.\n",
      "Hark! listen!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>For through the hushed crowd, pressing round the angle of the mill, and filling up Dunham Street,\n",
      "might be heard the rattle of the engine, the heavy, quick tread of loaded horses.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thank God!\" said Margaret's neighbour, \"the engine's come.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Another pause; the plugs were stiff, and water could not be got.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then there was a pressure through the crowd, the front rows bearing back on those behind, till\n",
      "the girls were sick with the close ramming confinement. Then a relaxation, and a breathing freely\n",
      "once more.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"'Twas young Wilson and a fireman wi' a ladder,\" said Margaret's neighbour, a tall man who could\n",
      "overlook the crowd.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, tell us what you see?\" begged Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They've gotten it fixed again the gin-shop wall. One o' the men i' th' factory has fell back;\n",
      "dazed wi' the smoke, I'll warrant. The floor's not given way there. God!\" said he, bringing his eye\n",
      "lower down, \"th' ladder's too short! It's a' over wi' them, poor chaps. Th' fire's coming slow and\n",
      "sure to that end, and afore they've either gotten water, or another ladder, they'll be dead out and\n",
      "out. Lord have mercy on them!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>A sob, as if of excited women, was heard in the hush of the crowd. Another pressure like the\n",
      "former! Mary clung to Margaret's arm with a pinching grasp, and longed to faint, and be insensible,\n",
      "to escape from the oppressing misery of her sensations. A minute or two.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They've taken th' ladder into th' Temple of Apollor. Can't press back with it to the yard it\n",
      "came from.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>A mighty shout arose; a sound to wake the dead. Up on high, quivering in the air, was seen the\n",
      "end of the ladder, protruding out of a garret window, in the gable end of the gin palace, nearly\n",
      "opposite to the doorway where the men had been seen. Those in the crowd nearest the factory, and\n",
      "consequently best able to see up to the garret window, said that several men were holding one end,\n",
      "and guiding by their weight its passage to the door-way. The garret window-frame had been taken out\n",
      "before the crowd below were aware of the attempt.</p>\n",
      "<p>At length—for it seemed long, measured by beating hearts, though scarce two minutes had\n",
      "elapsed—the ladder was fixed, an aerial bridge at a dizzy height, across the narrow street.</p>\n",
      "<p>Every eye was fixed in unwinking anxiety, and people's very breathing seemed stilled in suspense.\n",
      "The men were nowhere to be seen, but the wind appeared, for the moment, higher than ever, and drove\n",
      "back the invading flames to the other end.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary and Margaret could see now; right above them danced the ladder in the wind. The crowd\n",
      "pressed back from under; firemen's helmets appeared at the window, holding the ladder firm, when a\n",
      "man, with quick, steady tread, and unmoving head, passed from one side to the other. The multitude\n",
      "did not even whisper while he crossed the perilous bridge, which quivered under him; but when he was\n",
      "across, safe comparatively in the factory, a cheer arose for an instant, checked, however, almost\n",
      "immediately, by the uncertainty of the result, and the desire not in any way to shake the nerves of\n",
      "the brave fellow who had cast his life on such a die.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"There he is again!\" sprung to the lips of many, as they saw him at the doorway, standing as if\n",
      "for an instant to breathe a mouthful of the fresher air, before he trusted himself to cross. On his\n",
      "shoulders he bore an insensible body.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's Jem Wilson and his father,\" whispered Margaret; but Mary knew it before.</p>\n",
      "<p>The people were sick with anxious terror. He could no longer balance himself with his arms; every\n",
      "thing must depend on nerve and eye. They saw the latter was fixed, by the position of the head,\n",
      "which never wavered; the ladder shook under the double weight; but still he never moved his head—he\n",
      "dared not look below. It seemed an age before the crossing was accomplished. At last the window was\n",
      "gained; the bearer relieved from his burden; both had disappeared.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then the multitude might shout; and above the roaring flames, louder than the blowing of the\n",
      "mighty wind, arose that tremendous burst of applause at the success of the daring enterprise. Then a\n",
      "shrill cry was heard, asking</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is the oud man alive, and likely to do?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay,\" answered one of the firemen to the hushed crowd below. \"He's coming round finely, now he's\n",
      "had a dash of cowd water.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He drew back his head; and the eager inquiries, the shouts, the sea-like murmurs of the moving\n",
      "rolling mass began again to be heard—but for an instant though. In far less time than even that in\n",
      "which I have endeavoured briefly to describe the pause of events, the same bold hero stepped again\n",
      "upon the ladder, with evident purpose to rescue the man yet remaining in the burning mill.</p>\n",
      "<p>He went across in the same quick steady manner as before, and the people below, made less acutely\n",
      "anxious by his previous success, were talking to each other, shouting out intelligence of the\n",
      "progress of the fire at the other end of the factory, telling of the endeavours of the firemen at\n",
      "that part to obtain water, while the closely packed body of men heaved and rolled from side to side.\n",
      "It was different from the former silent breathless hush. I do not know if it were from this cause,\n",
      "or from the recollection of peril past, or that he looked below, in the breathing moment before\n",
      "returning with the remaining person (a slight little man) slung across his shoulders, but Jem\n",
      "Wilson's step was less steady, his tread more uncertain; he seemed to feel with his foot for the\n",
      "next round of the ladder, to waver, and finally to stop half-way. By this time the crowd was still\n",
      "enough; in the awful instant that intervened no one durst speak, even to encourage. Many turned sick\n",
      "with terror, and shut their eyes to avoid seeing the catastrophe they dreaded. It came. The brave\n",
      "man swayed from side to side, at first as slightly as if only balancing himself; but he was\n",
      "evidently losing nerve, and even sense: it was only wonderful how the animal instinct of\n",
      "self-preservation did not overcome every generous feeling, and impel him at once to drop the\n",
      "helpless, inanimate body he carried; perhaps the same instinct told him, that the sudden loss of so\n",
      "heavy a weight would of itself be a great and imminent danger.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Help me! she's fainted,\" cried Margaret. But no one heeded. All eyes were directed upwards. At\n",
      "this point of time a rope, with a running noose, was dexterously thrown by one of the firemen, after\n",
      "the manner of a lasso, over the head and round the bodies of the two men. True, it was with rude and\n",
      "slight adjustment: but, slight as it was, it served as a steadying guide; it encouraged the sinking\n",
      "heart, the dizzy head. Once more Jem stepped onwards. He was not hurried by any jerk or pull. Slowly\n",
      "and gradually the rope was hauled in, slowly and gradually did he make the four or five paces\n",
      "between him and safety. The window was gained, and all were saved. The multitude in the street\n",
      "absolutely danced with triumph, and huzzaed and yelled till you would have fancied their very\n",
      "throats would crack; and then with all the fickleness of interest characteristic of a large body of\n",
      "people, pressed and stumbled, and cursed and swore in the hurry to get out of Dunham Street, and\n",
      "back to the immediate scene of the fire, the mighty diapason of whose roaring flames formed an awful\n",
      "accompaniment to the screams, and yells, and imprecations, of the struggling crowd.</p>\n",
      "<p>As they pressed away, Margaret was left, pale and almost sinking under the weight of Mary's body,\n",
      "which she had preserved in an upright position by keeping her arms tight round Mary's waist,\n",
      "dreading, with reason, the trampling of unheeding feet.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, however, she gently let her down on the cold clean pavement; and the change of posture, and\n",
      "the difference in temperature, now that the people had withdrawn from their close neighbourhood,\n",
      "speedily restored her to consciousness.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her first glance was bewildered and uncertain. She had forgotten where she was. Her cold, hard\n",
      "bed felt strange; the murky glare in the sky affrighted her. She shut her eyes to think, to\n",
      "recollect.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her next look was upwards. The fearful bridge had been withdrawn; the window was unoccupied.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They are safe,\" said Margaret.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"All? Are all safe, Margaret?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ask yon fireman, and he'll tell you more about it than I can. But I know they're all safe.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The fireman hastily corroborated Margaret's words.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why did you let Jem Wilson go twice?\" asked Margaret.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Let!—why we could not hinder him. As soon as ever he'd heard his father speak (which he was na\n",
      "long a doing), Jem were off like a shot; only saying he knowed better nor us where to find t'other\n",
      "man. We'd all ha' gone, if he had na been in such a hurry, for no one can say as Manchester firemen\n",
      "is ever backward when there's danger.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So saying, he ran off; and the two girls, without remark or discussion, turned homewards. They\n",
      "were overtaken by the elder Wilson, pale, grimy, and blear-eyed, but apparently as strong and well\n",
      "as ever. He loitered a minute or two alongside of them, giving an account of his detention in the\n",
      "mill; he then hastily wished good-night, saying he must go home and tell his missis he was all safe\n",
      "and well: but after he had gone a few steps, he turned back, came on Mary's side of the pavement,\n",
      "and in an earnest whisper, which Margaret could not avoid hearing, he said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary, if my boy comes across you to-night, give him a kind word or two for my sake. Do! bless\n",
      "you, there's a good wench.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary hung her head and answered not a word, and in an instant he was gone.</p>\n",
      "<p>When they arrived at home, they found John Barton smoking his pipe, unwilling to question, yet\n",
      "very willing to hear all the details they could give him. Margaret went over the whole story, and it\n",
      "was amusing to watch his gradually increasing interest and excitement. First, the regular puffing\n",
      "abated, then ceased. Then the pipe was fairly taken out of his mouth, and held suspended. Then he\n",
      "rose, and at every further point he came a step nearer to the narrator.</p>\n",
      "<p>When it was ended, he swore (an unusual thing for him) that if Jem Wilson wanted Mary he should\n",
      "have her to-morrow, if he had not a penny to keep her.</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret laughed, but Mary, who was now recovered from her agitation, pouted, and looked\n",
      "angry.</p>\n",
      "<p>The work which they had left was resumed: but with full hearts, fingers never go very quickly;\n",
      "and I am sorry to say, that owing to the fire, the two younger Miss Ogdens were in such grief for\n",

      "improvements of late years, and worked but poorly in comparison with that which might now be\n",
      "procured. Above all, trade was very slack; cottons could find no market, and goods lay packed and\n",
      "piled in many a warehouse. The mills were merely worked to keep the machinery, human and metal, in\n",
      "some kind of order and readiness for better times. So this was an excellent opportunity, Messrs.\n",
      "Carson thought, for refitting their factory with first-rate improvements, for which the insurance\n",
      "money would amply pay. They were in no hurry about the business, however. The weekly drain of wages\n",
      "given for labour, useless in the present state of the market, was stopped. The partners had more\n",
      "leisure than they had known for years; and promised wives and daughters all manner of pleasant\n",
      "excursions, as soon as the weather should become more genial. It was a pleasant thing to be able to\n",
      "lounge over breakfast with a review or newspaper in hand; to have time for becoming acquainted with\n",
      "agreeable and accomplished daughters, on whose education no money had been spared, but whose\n",
      "fathers, shut up during a long day with calicoes and accounts, had so seldom had leisure to enjoy\n",
      "their daughters' talents. There were happy family evenings, now that the men of business had time\n",
      "for domestic enjoyments. There is another side to the picture. There were homes over which Carsons'\n",
      "fire threw a deep, terrible gloom; the homes of those who would fain work, and no man gave unto\n",
      "them—the homes of those to whom leisure was a curse. There, the family music was hungry wails, when\n",
      "week after week passed by, and there was no work to be had, and consequently no wages to pay for the\n",
      "bread the children cried aloud for in their young impatience of suffering. There was no breakfast to\n",
      "lounge over; their lounge was taken in bed, to try and keep warmth in them that bitter March\n",
      "weather, and, by being quiet, to deaden the gnawing wolf within. Many a penny that would have gone\n",
      "little way enough in oatmeal or potatoes, bought opium to still the hungry little ones, and make\n",
      "them forget their uneasiness in heavy troubled sleep. It was mother's mercy. The evil and the good\n",
      "of our nature came out strongly then. There were desperate fathers; there were bitter-tongued\n",
      "mothers (O God! what wonder!); there were reckless children; the very closest bonds of nature were\n",
      "snapt in that time of trial and distress. There was Faith such as the rich can never imagine on\n",
      "earth; there was \"Love strong as death;\" and self-denial, among rude, coarse men, akin to that of\n",
      "Sir Philip Sidney's most glorious deed. The vices of the poor sometimes astound us <hi>here</hi>;\n",
      "but when the secrets of all hearts shall be made known, their virtues will astound us in far greater\n",

      "<p>As the cold bleak spring came on (spring, in name alone), and consequently as trade continued\n",
      "dead, other mills shortened hours, turned off hands, and finally stopped work altogether.</p>\n",
      "<p>Barton worked short hours; Wilson, of course, being a hand in Carsons' factory, had no work at\n",
      "all. But his son, working at an engineer's, and a steady man, obtained wages enough to maintain all\n",
      "the family in a careful way. Still it preyed on Wilson's mind to be so long indebted to his son. He\n",
      "was out of spirits and depressed. Barton was morose, and soured towards mankind as a body, and the\n",
      "rich in particular. One evening, when the clear light at six o'clock contrasted strangely with the\n",
      "Christmas cold, and when the bitter wind piped down every entry, and through every cranny, Barton\n",
      "sat brooding over his stinted fire, and listening for Mary's step, in unacknowledged trust that her\n",
      "presence would cheer him. The door was opened, and Wilson came breathless in.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You've not got a bit o' money by you, Barton?\" asked he.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not I; who has now, I'd like to know. Whatten you want it for?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I donnot <ref target=\"#footnote11\">[11]</ref> want it for mysel, tho' we've none to spare. But\n",
      "don ye know Ben Davenport as worked at Carsons'? He's down wi' the fever, and ne'er a stick o' fire,\n",
      "nor a cowd <ref target=\"#footnote12\">[12]</ref> potato in the house.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I han got no money, I tell ye,\" said Barton. Wilson looked disappointed. Barton tried not to be\n",
      "interested, but he could not help it in spite of his gruffness. He rose, and went to the cupboard\n",
      "(his wife's pride long ago). There lay the remains of his dinner, hastily put by ready for supper.\n",
      "Bread, and a slice of cold fat boiled bacon. He wrapped them in his handkerchief, put them in the\n",
      "crown of his hat, and said—\"Come, let's be going.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Going—art thou going to work this time o' day?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, stupid, to be sure not. Going to see the fellow thou spoke on.\" So they put on their hats\n",
      "and set out. On the way Wilson said Davenport was a good fellow, though too much of the Methodee;\n",
      "that his children were too young to work, but not too young to be cold and hungry; that they had\n",
      "sunk lower and lower, and pawned thing after thing, and that now they lived in a cellar in Berry\n",
      "Street, off Store Street. Barton growled inarticulate words of no benevolent import to a large class\n",
      "of mankind, and so they went along till they arrived in Berry Street. It was unpaved; and down the\n",
      "middle a gutter forced its way, every now and then forming pools in the holes with which the street\n",
      "abounded. Never was the Old Edinburgh cry of \"Gardez l'eau\" more necessary than in this street. As\n",
      "they passed, women from their doors tossed household slops of <hi>every</hi> description into the\n",
      "gutter; they ran into the next pool, which overflowed and stagnated. Heaps of ashes were the\n",
      "stepping-stones, on which the passer-by, who cared in the least for cleanliness, took care not to\n",
      "put his foot. Our friends were not dainty, but even they picked their way till they got to some\n",
      "steps leading down into a small area, where a person standing would have his head about one foot\n",
      "below the level of the street, and might at the same time, without the least motion of his body,\n",
      "touch the window of the cellar and the damp muddy wall right opposite. You went down one step even\n",
      "from the foul area into the cellar in which a family of human beings lived. It was very dark inside.\n",
      "The window-panes were, many of them, broken and stuffed with rags, which was reason enough for the\n",
      "dusky light that pervaded the place even at mid-day. After the account I have given of the state of\n",
      "the street, no one can be surprised that on going into the cellar inhabited by Davenport, the smell\n",
      "was so fœtid as almost to knock the two men down. Quickly recovering themselves, as those inured to\n",
      "such things do, they began to penetrate the thick darkness of the place, and to see three or four\n",
      "little children rolling on the damp, nay wet, brick floor, through which the stagnant, filthy\n",
      "moisture of the street oozed up; the fire-place was empty and black; the wife sat on her husband's\n",
      "lair, and cried in the dank loneliness.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"See, missis, I'm back again.—Hold your noise, children, and don't mither <ref\n",
      "target=\"#footnote13\">[13]</ref> your mammy for bread; here's a chap as has got some for you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>In that dim light, which was darkness to strangers, they clustered round Barton, and tore from\n",
      "him the food he had brought with him. It was a large hunch of bread, but it vanished in an\n",
      "instant.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"We mun do summut for 'em,\" said he to Wilson. \"Yo stop here, and I'll be back in\n",
      "half-an-hour.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So he strode, and ran, and hurried home. He emptied into the ever-useful pocket-handkerchief the\n",
      "little meal remaining in the mug. Mary would have her tea at Miss Simmonds'; her food for the day\n",
      "was safe. Then he went up-stairs for his better coat, and his one, gay, red-and-yellow silk\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief—his jewels, his plate, his valuables, these were. He went to the pawn-shop; he\n",
      "pawned them for five shillings; he stopped not, nor stayed, till he was once more in London Road,\n",
      "within five minutes' walk of Berry Street—then he loitered in his gait, in order to discover the\n",
      "shops he wanted. He bought meat, and a loaf of bread, candles, chips, and from a little retail yard\n",
      "he purchased a couple of hundredweights of coals. Some money yet remained—all destined for them, but\n",
      "he did not yet know how best to spend it. Food, light, and warmth, he had instantly seen were\n",
      "necessary; for luxuries he would wait. Wilson's eyes filled with tears when he saw Barton enter with\n",
      "his purchases. He understood it all, and longed to be once more in work, that he might help in some\n",
      "of these material ways, without feeling that he was using his son's money. But though \"silver and\n",
      "gold he had none,\" he gave heart-service and love works of far more value. Nor was John Barton\n",
      "behind in these. \"The fever\" was (as it usually is in Manchester) of a low, putrid, typhoid kind;\n",
      "brought on by miserable living, filthy neighbourhood, and great depression of mind and body. It is\n",
      "virulent, malignant, and highly infectious. But the poor are fatalists with regard to infection; and\n",
      "well for them it is so, for in their crowded dwellings no invalid can be isolated. Wilson asked\n",
      "Barton if he thought he should catch it, and was laughed at for his idea.</p>\n",
      "<p>The two men, rough, tender nurses as they were, lighted the fire, which smoked and puffed into\n",
      "the room as if it did not know the way up the damp, unused chimney. The very smoke seemed purifying\n",
      "and healthy in the thick clammy air. The children clamoured again for bread; but this time Barton\n",
      "took a piece first to the poor, helpless, hopeless woman, who still sat by the side of her husband,\n",
      "listening to his anxious miserable mutterings. She took the bread, when it was put into her hand,\n",
      "and broke a bit, but could not eat. She was past hunger. She fell down on the floor with a heavy\n",
      "unresisting bang. The men looked puzzled. \"She's well-nigh clemmed,\" said Barton. \"Folk do say one\n",
      "mustn't give clemmed people much to eat; but, bless us, she'll eat nought.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll tell yo what I'll do,\" said Wilson. \"I'll take these two big lads, as does nought but\n",
      "fight, home to my missis's for to-night, and I'll get a jug o' tea. Them women always does best with\n",
      "tea and such-like slop.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So Barton was now left alone with a little child, crying (when it had done eating) for mammy;\n",
      "with a fainting, dead-like woman; and with the sick man, whose mutterings were rising up to screams\n",
      "and shrieks of agonised anxiety. He carried the woman to the fire, and chafed her hands. He looked\n",
      "around for something to raise her head. There was literally nothing but some loose bricks. However,\n",
      "those he got; and taking off his coat he covered them with it as well as he could. He pulled her\n",
      "feet to the fire, which now began to emit some faint heat. He looked round for water, but the poor\n",
      "woman had been too weak to drag herself out to the distant pump, and water there was none. He\n",
      "snatched the child, and ran up the area-steps to the room above, and borrowed their only saucepan\n",
      "with some water in it. Then he began, with the useful skill of a working-man, to make some gruel;\n",
      "and when it was hastily made he seized a battered iron table-spoon (kept when many other little\n",
      "things had been sold in a lot), in order to feed baby, and with it he forced one or two drops\n",
      "between her clenched teeth. The mouth opened mechanically to receive more, and gradually she\n",
      "revived. She sat up and looked round; and recollecting all, fell down again in weak and passive\n",
      "despair. Her little child crawled to her, and wiped with its fingers the thick-coming tears which\n",
      "she now had strength to weep. It was now high time to attend to the man. He lay on straw, so damp\n",
      "and mouldy no dog would have chosen it in preference to flags; over it was a piece of sacking,\n",
      "coming next to his worn skeleton of a body; above him was mustered every article of clothing that\n",
      "could be spared by mother or children this bitter weather; and in addition to his own, these might\n",
      "have given as much warmth as one blanket, could they have been kept on him; but as he restlessly\n",
      "tossed to and fro, they fell off and left him shivering in spite of the burning heat of his skin.\n",
      "Every now and then he started up in his naked madness, looking like the prophet of woe in the\n",
      "fearful plague-picture; but he soon fell again in exhaustion, and Barton found he must be closely\n",
      "watched, lest in these falls he should injure himself against the hard brick floor. He was thankful\n",
      "when Wilson re-appeared, carrying in both hands a jug of steaming tea, intended for the poor wife;\n",
      "but when the delirious husband saw drink, he snatched at it with animal instinct, with a selfishness\n",
      "he had never shown in health.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then the two men consulted together. It seemed decided, without a word being spoken on the\n",
      "subject, that both should spend the night with the forlorn couple; that was settled. But could no\n",
      "doctor be had? In all probability, no; the next day an infirmary order might be begged, but\n",
      "meanwhile the only medical advice they could have must be from a druggist's. So Barton (being the\n",
      "moneyed man) set out to find a shop in London Road.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is a pretty sight to walk through a street with lighted shops; the gas is so brilliant, the\n",
      "display of goods so much more vividly shown than by day, and of all shops a druggist's looks the\n",
      "most like the tales of our childhood, from Aladdin's garden of enchanted fruits to the charming\n",
      "Rosamond with her purple jar. No such associations had Barton; yet he felt the contrast between the\n",
      "well-filled, well-lighted shops and the dim gloomy cellar, and it made him moody that such contrasts\n",
      "should exist. They are the mysterious problem of life to more than him. He wondered if any in all\n",
      "the hurrying crowd had come from such a house of mourning. He thought they all looked joyous, and he\n",
      "was angry with them. But he could not, you cannot, read the lot of those who daily pass you by in\n",
      "the street. How do you know the wild romances of their lives; the trials, the temptations they are\n",
      "even now enduring, resisting, sinking under? You may be elbowed one instant by the girl desperate in\n",
      "her abandonment, laughing in mad merriment with her outward gesture, while her soul is longing for\n",
      "the rest of the dead, and bringing itself to think of the cold-flowing river as the only mercy of\n",
      "God remaining to her here. You may pass the criminal, meditating crimes at which you will to-morrow\n",
      "shudder with horror as you read them. You may push against one, humble and unnoticed, the last upon\n",
      "earth, who in Heaven will for ever be in the immediate light of God's countenance. Errands of\n",
      "mercy—errands of sin—did you ever think where all the thousands of people you daily meet are bound?\n",
      "Barton's was an errand of mercy; but the thoughts of his heart were touched by sin, by bitter hatred\n",
      "of the happy, whom he, for the time, confounded with the selfish.</p>\n",
      "<p>He reached a druggist's shop, and entered. The druggist (whose smooth manners seemed to have been\n",
      "salved over with his own spermaceti) listened attentively to Barton's description of Davenport's\n",
      "illness; concluded it was typhus fever, very prevalent in that neighbourhood; and proceeded to make\n",
      "up a bottle of medicine, sweet spirits of nitre, or some such innocent potion, very good for slight\n",
      "colds, but utterly powerless to stop, for an instant, the raging fever of the poor man it was\n",
      "intended to relieve. He recommended the same course they had previously determined to adopt,\n",
      "applying the next morning for an infirmary order; and Barton left the shop with comfortable faith in\n",
      "the physic given him; for men of his class, if they believe in physic at all, believe that every\n",
      "description is equally efficacious.</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, Wilson had done what he could at Davenport's home. He had soothed, and covered the man\n",
      "many a time; he had fed and hushed the little child, and spoken tenderly to the woman, who lay still\n",
      "in her weakness and her weariness. He had opened a door, but only for an instant; it led into a back\n",
      "cellar, with a grating instead of a window, down which dropped the moisture from pigsties, and worse\n",
      "abominations. It was not paved; the floor was one mass of bad smelling mud. It had never been used,\n",
      "for there was not an article of furniture in it; nor could a human being, much less a pig, have\n",
      "lived there many days. Yet the \"back apartment\" made a difference in the rent. The Davenports paid\n",
      "threepence more for having two rooms. When he turned round again, he saw the woman suckling the\n",
      "child from her dry, withered breast.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Surely the lad is weaned!\" exclaimed he, in surprise. \"Why, how old is he?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Going on two year,\" she faintly answered. \"But, oh! it keeps him quiet when I've nought else to\n",
      "gi' him, and he'll get a bit of sleep lying there, if he's getten <ref target=\"#footnote14\"\n",
      ">[14]</ref> nought beside. We han done our best to gi' the childer <ref target=\"#footnote15\"\n",

      "<p>And now all Wilson's care, and Barton's to boot, was wanted to restrain the wild mad agony of the\n",

      "swore, which surprised Wilson, who knew his piety in health, and who did not know the unbridled\n",

      "Han they done as they'd be done by for us?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But Wilson was no arguer; no speechifier as he would have called it. So Barton, seeing he was\n",
      "likely to have it his own way, went on.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You'll say (at least many a one does), they'n <ref target=\"#footnote18\">[18]</ref> getten\n",

      "we? They'n screwed us down to th' lowest peg, in order to make their great big fortunes, and build\n",
      "their great big houses, and we, why we're just clemming, many and many of us. Can you say there's\n",
      "nought wrong in this?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Barton, I'll not gainsay ye. But Mr. Carson spoke to me after th' fire, and says he, 'I\n",
      "shall ha' to retrench, and be very careful in my expenditure during these bad times, I assure ye;'\n",
      "so yo see th' masters suffer too.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Han they ever seen a child o' their'n die for want o' food?\" asked Barton, in a low, deep\n",

      "<p>\"I donnot mean,\" continued he, \"to say as I'm so badly off. I'd scorn to speak for mysel; but\n",
      "when I see such men as Davenport there dying away, for very clemming, I cannot stand it. I've but\n",

      "I donnot mind.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And in this kind of talk the night, the long heavy night of watching, wore away. As far as they\n",
      "could judge, Davenport continued in the same state, although the symptoms varied occasionally. The\n",
      "wife slept on, only roused by a cry of her child now and then, which seemed to have power over her,\n",
      "when far louder noises failed to disturb her. The watchers agreed, that as soon as it was likely Mr.\n",
      "Carson would be up and visible, Wilson should go to his house, and beg for an Infirmary order. At\n",
      "length the gray dawn penetrated even into the dark cellar. Davenport slept, and Barton was to remain\n",
      "there until Wilson's return; so stepping out into the fresh air, brisk and reviving, even in that\n",
      "street of abominations, Wilson took his way to Mr. Carson's.</p>\n",
      "<p>Wilson had about two miles to walk before he reached Mr. Carson's house, which was almost in the\n",
      "country. The streets were not yet bustling and busy. The shopmen were lazily taking down the\n",
      "shutters, although it was near eight o'clock; for the day was long enough for the purchases people\n",
      "made in that quarter of the town, while trade was so flat. One or two miserable-looking women were\n",
      "setting off on their day's begging expedition. But there were few people abroad. Mr. Carson's was a\n",
      "good house, and furnished with disregard to expense. But in addition to lavish expenditure, there\n",
      "was much taste shown, and many articles chosen for their beauty and elegance adorned his rooms. As\n",
      "Wilson passed a window which a housemaid had thrown open, he saw pictures and gilding, at which he\n",
      "was tempted to stop and look; but then he thought it would not be respectful. So he hastened on to\n",
      "the kitchen door. The servants seemed very busy with preparations for breakfast; but good-naturedly,\n",
      "though hastily, told him to step in, and they could soon let Mr. Carson know he was there. So he was\n",
      "ushered into a kitchen hung round with glittering tins, where a roaring fire burnt merrily, and\n",
      "where numbers of utensils hung round, at whose nature and use Wilson amused himself by guessing.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the servants bustled to and fro; an out-door man-servant came in for orders, and sat down\n",
      "near Wilson; the cook broiled steaks, and the kitchen-maid toasted bread, and boiled eggs.</p>\n",
      "<p>The coffee steamed upon the fire, and altogether the odours were so mixed and appetising, that\n",
      "Wilson began to yearn for food to break his fast, which had lasted since dinner the day before. If\n",
      "the servants had known this, they would have willingly given him meat and bread in abundance; but\n",
      "they were like the rest of us, and not feeling hunger themselves, forgot it was possible another\n",
      "might. So Wilson's craving turned to sickness, while they chattered on, making the kitchen's free\n",
      "and keen remarks upon the parlour.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How late you were last night, Thomas!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, I was right weary of waiting; they told me to be at the rooms by twelve; and there I was.\n",
      "But it was two o'clock before they called me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And did you wait all that time in the street?\" asked the housemaid, who had done her work for\n",
      "the present, and come into the kitchen for a bit of gossip.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My eye as like! you don't think I'm such a fool as to catch my death of cold, and let the horses\n",
      "catch their death too, as we should ha' done if we'd stopped there. No! I put th' horses up in th'\n",
      "stables at th' Spread Eagle, and went mysel, and got a glass or two by th' fire. They're driving a\n",
      "good custom, them, wi' coachmen. There were five on us, and we'd many a quart o' ale, and gin wi'\n",
      "it, to keep out cold.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mercy on us, Thomas; you'll get a drunkard at last!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If I do, I know whose blame it will be. It will be missis's, and not mine. Flesh and blood can't\n",
      "sit to be starved to death on a coach-box, waiting for folks as don't know their own mind.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>A servant, semi-upper-housemaid, semi-lady's-maid, now came down with orders from her\n",
      "mistress.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thomas, you must ride to the fishmonger's, and say missis can't give above half-a-crown a pound\n",
      "for salmon for Tuesday; she's grumbling because trade's so bad. And she'll want the carriage at\n",
      "three to go to the lecture, Thomas; at the Royal Execution, you know.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, ay, I know.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And you'd better all of you mind your P's and Q's, for she's very black this morning. She's got\n",
      "a bad headache.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's a pity Miss Jenkins is not here to match her. Lord! how she and missis did quarrel which\n",
      "had got the worst headaches; it was that Miss Jenkins left for; she would not give up having bad\n",
      "headaches, and missis could not abide any one to have 'em but herself.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Missis will have her breakfast up-stairs, cook, and the cold partridge as was left yesterday,\n",
      "and put plenty of cream in her coffee, and she thinks there's a roll left, and she would like it\n",
      "well buttered.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So saying, the maid left the kitchen to be ready to attend to the young ladies' bell when they\n",
      "chose to ring, after their late assembly the night before.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the luxurious library, at the well-spread breakfast-table, sat the two Mr. Carsons, father and\n",
      "son. Both were reading; the father a newspaper, the son a review, while they lazily enjoyed their\n",
      "nicely prepared food. The father was a prepossessing-looking old man; perhaps self-indulgent you\n",
      "might guess. The son was strikingly handsome, and knew it. His dress was neat and well appointed,\n",
      "and his manners far more gentlemanly than his father's. He was the only son, and his sisters were\n",
      "proud of him; his father and mother were proud of him: he could not set up his judgment against\n",
      "theirs; he was proud of himself.</p>\n",
      "<p>The door opened and in bounded Amy, the sweet youngest daughter of the house, a lovely girl of\n",
      "sixteen, fresh and glowing, and bright as a rosebud. She was too young to go to assemblies, at which\n",
      "her father rejoiced, for he had little Amy with her pretty jokes, and her bird-like songs, and her\n",
      "playful caresses all the evening to amuse him in his loneliness; and she was not too much tired,\n",
      "like Sophy and Helen, to give him her sweet company at breakfast the next morning.</p>\n",
      "<p>He submitted willingly while she blinded him with her hands, and kissed his rough red face all\n",
      "over. She took his newspaper away after a little pretended resistance, and would not allow her\n",
      "brother Harry to go on with his review.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm the only lady this morning, papa, so you know you must make a great deal of me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My darling, I think you have your own way always, whether you're the only lady or not.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, papa, you're pretty good and obedient, I must say that; but I'm sorry to say Harry is very\n",
      "naughty, and does not do what I tell him; do you, Harry?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm sure I don't know what you mean to accuse me of, Amy; I expected praise and not blame; for\n",
      "did not I get you that eau de Portugal from town, that you could not meet with at Hughes', you\n",
      "little ungrateful puss?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Did you! Oh, sweet Harry; you're as sweet as eau de Portugal yourself; you're almost as good as\n",
      "papa; but still you know you did go and forget to ask Bigland for that rose, that new rose they say\n",
      "he has got.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, Amy, I did not forget. I asked him, and he has got the Rose, <hi>sans reproche</hi>; but do\n",
      "you know, little Miss Extravagance, a very small one is half-a-guinea?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, I don't mind. Papa will give it me, won't you, dear father? He knows his little daughter\n",
      "can't live without flowers and scents.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson tried to refuse his darling, but she coaxed him into acquiescence, saying she must\n",
      "have it, it was one of her necessaries. Life was not worth having without flowers.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then, Amy,\" said her brother, \"try and be content with peonies and dandelions.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, you wretch! I don't call them flowers. Besides, you're every bit as extravagant. Who gave\n",
      "half-a-crown for a bunch of lilies of the valley at Yates', a month ago, and then would not let his\n",
      "poor little sister have them, though she went on her knees to beg them? Answer me that, Master\n",
      "Hal.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not on compulsion,\" replied her brother, smiling with his mouth, while his eyes had an irritated\n",
      "expression, and he went first red, then pale, with vexed embarrassment.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If you please, sir,\" said a servant, entering the room, \"here's one of the mill people wanting\n",
      "to see you; his name is Wilson, he says.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll come to him directly; stay, tell him to come in here.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Amy danced off into the conservatory which opened out of the room, before the gaunt, pale,\n",
      "unwashed, unshaven weaver was ushered in. There he stood at the door, sleeking his hair with old\n",
      "country habit, and every now and then stealing a glance round at the splendour of the apartment.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Wilson, and what do you want to-day, man?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Please, sir, Davenport's ill of the fever, and I'm come to know if you've got an Infirmary order\n",
      "for him?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Davenport—Davenport; who is the fellow? I don't know the name.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He's worked in your factory better nor three year, sir.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Very likely; I don't pretend to know the names of the men I employ; that I leave to the\n",
      "overlooker. So he's ill, eh?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, sir, he's very bad; we want to get him in at the fever wards.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I doubt if I have an in-patient's order to spare; they're always wanted for accidents, you know.\n",
      "But I'll give you an out-patient's, and welcome.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So saying, he rose up, unlocked a drawer, pondered a minute, and then gave Wilson an\n",
      "out-patient's order to be presented the following Monday. Monday! How many days there were before\n",
      "Monday!</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, the younger Mr. Carson had ended his review, and began to listen to what was going on.\n",
      "He finished his breakfast, got up, and pulled five shillings out of his pocket, which he gave to\n",
      "Wilson as he passed him, for the \"poor fellow.\" He went past quickly, and calling for his horse,\n",
      "mounted gaily, and rode away. He was anxious to be in time to have a look and a smile from lovely\n",
      "Mary Barton, as she went to Miss Simmonds'. But to-day he was to be disappointed. Wilson left the\n",
      "house, not knowing whether to be pleased or grieved. It was long to Monday, but they had all spoken\n",
      "kindly to him, and who could tell if they might not remember this, and do something before Monday.\n",
      "Besides, the cook, who, when she had had time to think, after breakfast was sent in, had noticed his\n",
      "paleness, had had meat and bread ready to put in his hand when he came out of the parlour; and a\n",
      "full stomach makes every one of us more hopeful.</p>\n",
      "<p>When he reached Berry Street, he had persuaded himself he bore good news, and felt almost elated\n",
      "in his heart. But it fell when he opened the cellar-door, and saw Barton and the wife both bending\n",
      "over the sick man's couch with awe-struck, saddened look.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come here,\" said Barton. \"There's a change comed over him sin' yo left, is there not?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Wilson looked. The flesh was sunk, the features prominent, bony, and rigid. The fearful\n",
      "clay-colour of death was over all. But the eyes were open and sensible, though the films of the\n",
      "grave were settling upon them.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He wakened fra his sleep, as yo left him in, and began to mutter and moan; but he soon went off\n",
      "again, and we never knew he were awake till he called his wife, but now she's here he's gotten\n",
      "nought to say to her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Most probably, as they all felt, he could not speak, for his strength was fast ebbing. They stood\n",
      "round him still and silent; even the wife checked her sobs, though her heart was like to break. She\n",
      "held her child to her breast, to try and keep him quiet. Their eyes were all fixed on the yet living\n",
      "one, whose moments of life were passing so rapidly away. At length he brought (with jerking,\n",
      "convulsive effort) his two hands into the attitude of prayer. They saw his lips move, and bent to\n",
      "catch the words, which came in gasps, and not in tones.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh Lord God! I thank thee, that the hard struggle of living is over.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Ben! Ben!\" wailed forth his wife, \"have you no thought for me? Oh, Ben! Ben! do say one word\n",
      "to help me through life.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He could not speak again. The trump of the archangel would set his tongue free; but not a word\n",
      "more would it utter till then. Yet he heard, he understood, and though sight failed, he moved his\n",
      "hand gropingly over the covering. They knew what he meant, and guided it to her head, bowed and\n",
      "hidden in her hands, when she had sunk in her woe. It rested there, with a feeble pressure of\n",
      "endearment. The face grew beautiful, as the soul neared God. A peace beyond understanding came over\n",
      "it. The hand was a heavy, stiff weight on the wife's head. No more grief or sorrow for him. They\n",
      "reverently laid out the corpse—Wilson fetching his only spare shirt to array it in. The wife still\n",
      "lay hidden in the clothes, in a stupor of agony.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a knock at the door, and Barton went to open it. It was Mary, who had received a\n",
      "message from her father, through a neighbour, telling her where he was; and she had set out early to\n",
      "come and have a word with him before her day's work; but some errands she had to do for Miss\n",
      "Simmonds had detained her until now.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come in, wench!\" said her father. \"Try if thou canst comfort yon poor, poor woman, kneeling down\n",
      "there. God help her.\" Mary did not know what to say, or how to comfort; but she knelt down by her,\n",
      "and put her arm round her neck, and in a little while fell to crying herself so bitterly, that the\n",
      "source of tears was opened by sympathy in the widow, and her full heart was, for a time,\n",
      "relieved.</p>\n",
      "<p>And Mary forgot all purposed meeting with her gay lover, Harry Carson; forgot Miss Simmonds'\n",
      "errands, and her anger, in the anxious desire to comfort the poor lone woman. Never had her sweet\n",
      "face looked more angelic, never had her gentle voice seemed so musical as when she murmured her\n",
      "broken sentences of comfort.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, don't cry so, dear Mrs. Davenport, pray don't take on so. Sure he's gone where he'll never\n",
      "know care again. Yes, I know how lonesome you must feel; but think of your children. Oh! we'll all\n",
      "help to earn food for 'em. Think how sorry <hi>he'd</hi> be, if he sees you fretting so. Don't cry\n",
      "so, please don't.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And she ended by crying herself, as passionately as the poor widow.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was agreed that the town must bury him; he had paid to a burial club as long as he could; but\n",
      "by a few weeks' omission, he had forfeited his claim to a sum of money now. Would Mrs. Davenport and\n",
      "the little child go home with Mary? The latter brightened up as she urged this plan; but no! where\n",
      "the poor, fondly loved remains were, there would the mourner be; and all that they could do was to\n",
      "make her as comfortable as their funds would allow, and to beg a neighbour to look in and say a word\n",
      "at times. So she was left alone with her dead, and they went to work that had work, and he who had\n",
      "none, took upon him the arrangements for the funeral.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary had many a scolding from Miss Simmonds that day for her absence of mind. To be sure Miss\n",
      "Simmonds was much put out by Mary's non-appearance in the morning with certain bits of muslin, and\n",
      "shades of silk which were wanted to complete a dress to be worn that night; but it was true enough\n",
      "that Mary did not mind what she was about; she was too busy planning how her old black gown (her\n",
      "best when her mother died) might be spunged, and turned, and lengthened into something like decent\n",
      "mourning for the widow. And when she went home at night (though it was very late, as a sort of\n",
      "retribution for her morning's negligence), she set to work at once, and was so busy, and so glad\n",
      "over her task, that she had, every now and then, to check herself in singing merry ditties, that she\n",
      "felt little accorded with the sewing on which she was engaged.</p>\n",
      "<p>So when the funeral day came, Mrs. Davenport was neatly arrayed in black, a satisfaction to her\n",
      "poor heart in the midst of her sorrow. Barton and Wilson both accompanied her, as she led her two\n",
      "elder boys, and followed the coffin. It was a simple walking funeral, with nothing to grate on the\n",
      "feelings of any; far more in accordance with its purpose, to my mind, than the gorgeous hearses, and\n",
      "nodding plumes, which form the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people. There was no \"rattling\n",
      "the bones over the stones,\" of the pauper's funeral. Decently and quietly was he followed to the\n",
      "grave by one determined to endure her woe meekly for his sake. The only mark of pauperism attendant\n",
      "on the burial concerned the living and joyous, far more than the dead, or the sorrowful. When they\n",
      "arrived in the churchyard, they halted before a raised and handsome tombstone; in reality a wooden\n",

      "softly, gently, as fearing to disturb the troubled, gasping child; while behind her, old Alice let\n",
      "her fast-dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin, which she was laying out on a\n",
      "board, placed on a sort of sofa-settee in a corner of the room. Over the child, which yet breathed,\n",
      "the father bent, watching anxiously for some ground of hope, where hope there was none. Mary stepped\n",

      "<p>\"Ay, poor lad! God has taken him early, Mary.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary could not speak; she did not know what to say; it was so much worse than she expected. At\n",
      "last she ventured to whisper,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is there any chance for the other one, think you?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Alice shook her head, and told with a look that she believed there was none. She next endeavoured\n",
      "to lift the little body, and carry it to its old accustomed bed in its parents' room. But earnest as\n",
      "the father was in watching the yet-living, he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead, and\n",
      "sprang gently up, and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength, and\n",
      "carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him.</p>\n",
      "<p>The other child gasped longer, louder, with more of effort.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"We mun get him away from his mother. He cannot die while she's wishing him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Wishing him?\" said Mary, in a tone of inquiry.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay; donno ye know what wishing means? There's none can die in the arms of those who are wishing\n",
      "them sore to stay on earth. The soul o' them as holds them won't let the dying soul go free; so it\n",
      "has a hard struggle for the quiet of death. We mun get him away fra' his mother, or he'll have a\n",
      "hard death, poor lile <ref target=\"#footnote20\">[20]</ref> fellow.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking child. But the mother would\n",
      "not let him go, and looking in Alice's face with brimming and imploring eyes, declared in earnest\n",
      "whispers, that she was not wishing him, that she would fain have him released from his suffering.\n",
      "Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child, whose struggles seemed to increase, till\n",

      "heart's wishing him a' this while, for I cannot, no, I cannot bring mysel to let my two childer go\n",
      "in one day; I cannot help longing to keep him, and yet he sha'not suffer longer for me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She bent down, and fondly, oh! with what passionate fondness, kissed her child, and then gave him\n",
      "up to Alice, who took him with tender care. Nature's struggles were soon exhausted, and he breathed\n",
      "his little life away in peace.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then the mother lifted up her voice and wept. Her cries brought her husband down to try with his\n",
      "aching heart to comfort hers. Again Alice laid out the dead, Mary helping with reverent fear. The\n",
      "father and mother carried him up-stairs to the bed, where his little brother lay in calm repose.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary and Alice drew near the fire, and stood in quiet sorrow for some time. Then Alice broke the\n",
      "silence by saying,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It will be bad news for Jem, poor fellow, when he comes home.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where is he?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Working over-hours at th' shop. They'n getten a large order fra' forrin parts; and yo' know, Jem\n",
      "mun work, though his heart's well-nigh breaking for these poor laddies.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Again they were silent in thought, and again Alice spoke first.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I sometimes think the Lord is against planning. Whene'er I plan over-much, He is sure to send\n",
      "and mar all my plans, as if He would ha' me put the future into His hands. Afore Christmas-time I\n",
      "was as full as full could be, of going home for good and all; yo' han heard how I've wished it this\n",
      "terrible long time. And a young lass from behind Burton came into place in Manchester last\n",
      "Martinmas; so after awhile, she had a Sunday out, and she comes to me, and tells me some cousins o'\n",
      "mine bid her find me out, and say how glad they should be to ha' me to bide wi' 'em, and look after\n",
      "th' childer, for they'n getten a big farm, and she's a deal to do among th' cows. So many a winter's\n",
      "night did I lie awake and think, that please God, come summer, I'd bid George and his wife good bye,\n",
      "and go home at last. Little did I think how God Almighty would baulk me, for not leaving my days in\n",
      "His hands, who had led me through the wilderness hitherto. Here's George out o' work, and more cast\n",
      "down than ever I seed him; wanting every chip o' comfort he can get, e'en afore this last heavy\n",
      "stroke; and now I'm thinking the Lord's finger points very clear to my fit abiding place; and I'm\n",
      "sure if George and Jane can say 'His will be done,' it's no more than what I'm beholden to do.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So saying, she fell to tidying the room, removing as much as she could every vestige of sickness;\n",
      "making up the fire, and setting on the kettle for a cup of tea for her sister-in-law, whose low\n",
      "moans and sobs were occasionally heard in the room below.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary helped her in all these little offices. They were busy in this way when the door was softly\n",
      "opened, and Jem came in, all grimed and dirty from his night-work, his soiled apron wrapped round\n",
      "his middle, in guise and apparel in which he would have been sorry at another time to have been seen\n",
      "by Mary. But just now he hardly saw her; he went straight up to Alice, and asked how the little\n",
      "chaps were. They had been a shade better at dinner-time, and he had been working away through the\n",
      "long afternoon, and far into the night, in the belief that they had taken the turn. He had stolen\n",
      "out during the half-hour allowed at the works for tea, to buy them an orange or two, which now\n",
      "puffed out his jacket-pocket.</p>\n",
      "<p>He would make his aunt speak; he would not understand her shakes of the head and fast coursing\n",
      "tears.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They're both gone,\" said she.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dead!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! poor fellows. They took worse about two o'clock. Joe went first, as easy as a lamb, and Will\n",
      "died harder like.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Both!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, lad! both. The Lord has ta'en them from some evil to come, or He would na ha' made choice o'\n",
      "them. Ye may rest sure o' that.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem went to the cupboard, and quietly extricated from his pocket the oranges he had bought. But\n",
      "he stayed long there, and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony. The two women were\n",
      "frightened, as women always are, on witnessing a man's overpowering grief. They cried afresh in\n",
      "company. Mary's heart melted within her as she witnessed Jem's sorrow, and she stepped gently up to\n",
      "the corner where he stood, with his back turned to them, and putting her hand softly on his arm,\n",
      "said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Jem, don't give way so; I cannot bear to see you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart, and knew the power she had of comforting him. He did\n",
      "not speak, as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment, when her\n",
      "soft hand's touch thrilled through his frame, and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his\n",
      "ear. Yes! it might be very wrong; he could almost hate himself for it; with death and woe so\n",
      "surrounding him, it yet was happiness, was bliss, to be so spoken to by Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't, Jem, please don't,\" whispered she again, believing that his silence was only another form\n",
      "of grief.</p>\n",
      "<p>He could not contain himself. He took her hand in his firm yet trembling grasp, and said, in\n",
      "tones that instantly produced a revulsion in her mood,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary, I almost loathe myself when I feel I would not give up this minute, when my brothers lie\n",
      "dead, and father and mother are in such trouble, for all my life that's past and gone. And, Mary (as\n",
      "she tried to release her hand), you know what makes me feel so blessed.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She did know—he was right there. But as he turned to catch a look at her sweet face, he saw that\n",
      "it expressed unfeigned distress, almost amounting to vexation; a dread of him, that he thought was\n",
      "almost repugnance.</p>\n",
      "<p>He let her hand go, and she quickly went away to Alice's side.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Fool that I was—nay, wretch that I was—to let myself take this time of trouble to tell her how I\n",
      "loved her; no wonder that she turns away from such a selfish beast.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Partly to relieve her from his presence, and partly from natural desire, and partly, perhaps,\n",
      "from a penitent wish to share to the utmost his parents' sorrow, he soon went up-stairs to the\n",
      "chamber of death.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she performed through the remainder of that long\n",
      "night, but she did not see Jem again. He remained up-stairs until after the early dawn showed Mary\n",
      "that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet streets, to try and get a\n",
      "little sleep before work hour. So leaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson, and hesitating\n",
      "whether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem, and deciding that she had better not, she\n",
      "stepped out into the bright morning light, so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had\n",
      "been.</p>\n",
      "<quote><l>\"They had</l><l>Another morn than ours.\"</l></quote>\n",
      "<p>Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes; and whether it was this, or the broad daylight that\n",
      "poured in through the sky-window, or whether it was over-excitement, it was long before she could\n",
      "catch a wink of sleep. Her thoughts ran on Jem's manner and words; not but what she had known the\n",
      "tale they told for many a day; but still she wished he had not put it so plainly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh dear,\" said she to herself, \"I wish he would not mistake me so; I never dare to speak a\n",
      "common word o' kindness, but his eye brightens and his cheek flushes. It's very hard on me; for\n",
      "father and George Wilson are old friends; and Jem and I ha' known each other since we were quite\n",
      "children. I cannot think what possesses me, that I must always be wanting to comfort him when he's\n",
      "downcast, and that I must go meddling wi' him to-night, when sure enough it was his aunt's place to\n",
      "speak to him. I don't care for him, and yet, unless I'm always watching myself, I'm speaking to him\n",
      "in a loving voice. I think I cannot go right, for I either check myself till I'm downright cross to\n",
      "him, or else I speak just natural, and that's too kind and tender by half. And I'm as good as\n",
      "engaged to be married to another; and another far handsomer than Jem; only I think I like Jem's face\n",
      "best for all that; liking's liking, and there's no help for it. Well, when I'm Mrs. Harry Carson,\n",
      "may happen I can put some good fortune in Jem's way. But will he thank me for it? He's rather savage\n",
      "at times, that I can see, and perhaps kindness from me, when I'm another's, will only go against the\n",
      "grain. I'll not plague myself wi' thinking any more about him, that I won't.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So she turned on her pillow, and fell asleep, and dreamt of what was often in her waking\n",
      "thoughts; of the day when she should ride from church in her carriage, with wedding-bells ringing,\n",
      "and take up her astonished father, and drive away from the old dim work-a-day court for ever, to\n",
      "live in a grand house, where her father should have newspapers, and pamphlets, and pipes, and meat\n",
      "dinners every day,—and all day long if he liked.</p>\n",
      "<p>Such thoughts mingled in her predilection for the handsome young Mr. Carson, who, unfettered by\n",
      "work-hours, let scarcely a day pass without contriving a meeting with the beautiful little milliner\n",
      "he had first seen while lounging in a shop where his sisters were making some purchases, and\n",
      "afterwards never rested till he had freely, though respectfully, made her acquaintance in her daily\n",
      "walks. He was, to use his own expression to himself, quite infatuated by her, and was restless each\n",
      "day till the time came when he had a chance, and, of late, more than a chance of meeting her. There\n",
      "was something of keen practical shrewdness about her, which contrasted very bewitchingly with the\n",
      "simple, foolish, unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which Miss Simmonds' young\n",
      "ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other.</p>\n",
      "<p>Yes! Mary was ambitious, and did not favour Mr. Carson the less because he was rich and a\n",
      "gentleman. The old leaven, infused years ago by her aunt Esther, fermented in her little bosom, and\n",
      "perhaps all the more, for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle. Such is the contrariness\n",
      "of the human heart, from Eve downwards, that we all, in our old-Adam state, fancy things forbidden\n",
      "sweetest. So Mary dwelt upon and enjoyed the idea of some day becoming a lady, and doing all the\n",
      "elegant nothings appertaining to ladyhood. It was a comfort to her, when scolded by Miss Simmonds,\n",
      "to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage, to order her gowns from\n",
      "the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker. It was a pleasure to her to hear the general admiration of\n",
      "the two elder Miss Carsons, acknowledged beauties in ball-room and street, on horseback and on foot,\n",
      "and to think of the time when she should ride and walk with them in loving sisterhood. But the best\n",
      "of her plans, the holiest, that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest, were those\n",
      "relating to her father; her dear father, now oppressed with care, and always a disheartened, gloomy\n",
      "person. How she would surround him with every comfort she could devise (of course, he was to live\n",
      "with them), till he should acknowledge riches to be very pleasant things, and bless his\n",
      "lady-daughter! Every one who had shown her kindness in her low estate should then be repaid a\n",
      "hundred-fold.</p>\n",
      "<p>Such were the castles in air, the Alnaschar-visions in which Mary indulged, and which she was\n",
      "doomed in after days to expiate with many tears.</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, her words—or, even more, her tones—would maintain their hold on Jem Wilson's memory. A\n",

      "<p>\"Ay, ay! else where's the use? It's only taking out o' the masters' pocket what they can well\n",

      "o' spelling that I'd ne'er been used to, that I'd to look first at th' copy and then at my letters,\n",
      "for all the world like a cock picking up grains o' corn. But one thing startled me e'en then, and I\n",
      "thought I'd make bold to ask the surgeon the meaning o't. I've gotten no head for numbers, but this\n",
      "I know, that by <hi>far th' greater part o' th' accidents as comed in, happened in th' last two\n",
      "hours o' work</hi>, when folk getten tired and careless. Th' surgeon said it were all true, and that\n",
      "he were going to bring that fact to light.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem was pondering Mary's conduct; but the pause made him aware he ought to utter some civil\n",

      "<p>\"Working folk won't be ground to the dust much longer. We'n a' had as much to bear as human\n",

      "<p>Still Jem was not curious. He gave up hope of seeing Mary again by her own good free will; and\n",

      "serve as an excuse for his sudden departure, he hastily wished John good afternoon, and left him to\n",
      "resume his pipe and his politics.</p>\n",
      "<p>For three years past, trade had been getting worse and worse, and the price of provisions higher\n",
      "and higher. This disparity between the amount of the earnings of the working classes and the price\n",
      "of their food, occasioned, in more cases than could well be imagined, disease and death. Whole\n",
      "families went through a gradual starvation. They only wanted a Dante to record their sufferings. And\n",
      "yet even his words would fall short of the awful truth; they could only present an outline of the\n",
      "tremendous facts of the destitution that surrounded thousands upon thousands in the terrible years\n",
      "1839, 1840, and 1841. Even philanthropists who had studied the subject, were forced to own\n",
      "themselves perplexed in their endeavour to ascertain the real causes of the misery; the whole matter\n",
      "was of so complicated a nature, that it became next to impossible to understand it thoroughly. It\n",
      "need excite no surprise then to learn that a bad feeling between working-men and the upper classes\n",
      "became very strong in this season of privation. The indigence and sufferings of the operatives\n",
      "induced a suspicion in the minds of many of them, that their legislators, their magistrates, their\n",
      "employers, and even the ministers of religion, were, in general, their oppressors and enemies; and\n",
      "were in league for their prostration and enthralment. The most deplorable and enduring evil that\n",
      "arose out of the period of commercial depression to which I refer, was this feeling of alienation\n",
      "between the different classes of society. It is so impossible to describe, or even faintly to\n",
      "picture, the state of distress which prevailed in the town at that time, that I will not attempt it;\n",
      "and yet I think again that surely, in a Christian land, it was not known even so feebly as words\n",
      "could tell it, or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged with their sympathy and their\n",
      "aid. In many instances the sufferers wept first, and then they cursed. Their vindictive feelings\n",
      "exhibited themselves in rabid politics. And when I hear, as I have heard, of the sufferings and\n",
      "privations of the poor, of provision shops where ha'porths of tea, sugar, butter, and even flour,\n",
      "were sold to accommodate the indigent,—of parents sitting in their clothes by the fire-side during\n",
      "the whole night for seven weeks together, in order that their only bed and bedding might be reserved\n",
      "for the use of their large family,—of others sleeping upon the cold hearth-stone for weeks in\n",
      "succession, without adequate means of providing themselves with food or fuel (and this in the depth\n",
      "of winter),—of others being compelled to fast for days together, uncheered by any hope of better\n",
      "fortune, living, moreover, or rather starving, in a crowded garret, or damp cellar, and gradually\n",
      "sinking under the pressure of want and despair into a premature grave; and when this has been\n",
      "confirmed by the evidence of their care-worn looks, their excited feelings, and their desolate\n",
      "homes,—can I wonder that many of them, in such times of misery and destitution, spoke and acted with\n",
      "ferocious precipitation?</p>\n",
      "<p>An idea was now springing up among the operatives, that originated with the Chartists, but which\n",
      "came at last to be cherished as a darling child by many and many a one. They could not believe that\n",
      "government knew of their misery; they rather chose to think it possible that men could voluntarily\n",
      "assume the office of legislators for a nation, ignorant of its real state; as who should make\n",
      "domestic rules for the pretty behaviour of children, without caring to know that those children had\n",
      "been kept for days without food. Besides, the starving multitudes had heard, that the very existence\n",
      "of their distress had been denied in Parliament; and though they felt this strange and inexplicable,\n",
      "yet the idea that their misery had still to be revealed in all its depths, and that then some remedy\n",
      "would be found, soothed their aching hearts, and kept down their rising fury.</p>\n",
      "<p>So a petition was framed, and signed by thousands in the bright spring days of 1839, imploring\n",
      "Parliament to hear witnesses who could testify to the unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing\n",
      "districts. Nottingham, Sheffield, Glasgow, Manchester, and many other towns, were busy appointing\n",
      "delegates to convey this petition, who might speak, not merely of what they had seen, and had heard,\n",
      "but from what they had borne and suffered. Life-worn, gaunt, anxious, hunger-stamped men, were those\n",
      "delegates.</p>\n",
      "<p>One of them was John Barton. He would have been ashamed to own the flutter of spirits his\n",
      "appointment gave him. There was the childish delight of seeing London—that went a little way, and\n",
      "but a little way. There was the vain idea of speaking out his notions before so many grand folk—that\n",
      "went a little further; and last, there was the really pure gladness of heart, arising from the idea\n",
      "that he was one of those chosen to be instruments in making known the distresses of the people, and\n",
      "consequently in procuring them some grand relief, by means of which they should never suffer want or\n",
      "care any more. He hoped largely, but vaguely, of the results of his expedition. An argosy of the\n",
      "precious hopes of many otherwise despairing creatures, was that petition to be heard concerning\n",
      "their sufferings.</p>\n",
      "<p>The night before the morning on which the Manchester delegates were to leave for London, Barton\n",
      "might be said to hold a levée, so many neighbours came dropping in. Job Legh had early established\n",
      "himself and his pipe by John Barton's fire, not saying much, but puffing away, and imagining himself\n",
      "of use in adjusting the smoothing-irons that hung before the fire, ready for Mary when she should\n",
      "want them. As for Mary, her employment was the same as that of Beau Tibbs' wife, \"just washing her\n",
      "father's two shirts,\" in the pantry back-kitchen; for she was anxious about his appearance in\n",
      "London. (The coat had been redeemed, though the silk handkerchief was forfeited.) The door stood\n",
      "open, as usual, between the houseplace and back-kitchen, so she gave her greeting to their friends\n",
      "as they entered.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So, John, yo're bound for London, are yo?\" said one.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, I suppose I mun go,\" answered John, yielding to necessity as it were.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, there's many a thing I'd like yo to speak on to the Parliament people. Thou'lt not spare\n",
      "'em, John, I hope. Tell 'em our minds; how we're thinking we've been clemmed long enough, and we\n",
      "donnot see whatten good they'n been doing, if they can't give us what we're all crying for sin' the\n",
      "day we were born.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, ay! I'll tell 'em that, and much more to it, when it gets to my turn; but thou knows there's\n",
      "many will have their word afore me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, thou'lt speak at last. Bless thee, lad, do ask 'em to make th' masters break th' machines.\n",
      "There's never been good times sin' spinning-jennies came up.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Machines is th' ruin of poor folk,\" chimed in several voices.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"For my part,\" said a shivering, half-clad man, who crept near the fire, as if ague-stricken, \"I\n",
      "would like thee to tell 'em to pass th' Short-hours Bill. Flesh and blood gets wearied wi' so much\n",
      "work; why should factory hands work so much longer nor other trades? Just ask 'em that, Barton, will\n",
      "ye?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Barton was saved the necessity of answering, by the entrance of Mrs. Davenport, the poor widow he\n",
      "had been so kind to; she looked half-fed, and eager, but was decently clad. In her hand she brought\n",
      "a little newspaper parcel, which she took to Mary, who opened it, and then called out, dangling a\n",
      "shirt collar from her soapy fingers:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"See, father, what a dandy you'll be in London! Mrs. Davenport has brought you this; made new\n",
      "cut, all after the fashion.—Thank you for thinking on him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Eh, Mary!\" said Mrs. Davenport, in a low voice. \"Whatten's all I can do, to what he's done for\n",
      "me and mine? But, Mary, sure I can help ye, for you'll be busy wi' this journey.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Just help me wring these out, and then I'll take 'em to th' mangle.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So Mrs. Davenport became a listener to the conversation; and after a while joined in.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm sure, John Barton, if yo are taking messages to the Parliament folk, yo'll not object to\n",
      "telling 'em what a sore trial it is, this law o' theirs, keeping childer fra' factory work, whether\n",
      "they be weakly or strong. There's our Ben; why, porridge seems to go no way wi' him, he eats so\n",
      "much; and I han gotten no money to send him t' school, as I would like; and there he is, rampaging\n",
      "about th' streets a' day, getting hungrier and hungrier, and picking up a' manner o' bad ways; and\n",
      "th' inspector won't let him in to work in th' factory, because he's not right age; though he's twice\n",
      "as strong as Sankey's little ritling <ref target=\"#footnote24\">[24]</ref> of a lad, as works till he\n",
      "cries for his legs aching so, though he is right age, and better.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I've one plan I wish to tell John Barton,\" said a pompous, careful-speaking man, \"and I should\n",

      "stories of their grandeur; and one thing she named were, that Sir Francis wore two shirts a day. Now\n",
      "he were all as one as a Parliament man; and many on 'em, I han no doubt, are like extravagant. Just\n",
      "tell 'em, John, do, that they'd be doing th' Lancashire weavers a great kindness, if they'd ha'\n",
      "their shirts a' made o' calico; 'twould make trade brisk, that would, wi' the power o' shirts they\n",
      "wear.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job Legh now put in his word. Taking the pipe out of his mouth, and addressing the last speaker,\n",
      "he said:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll tell ye what, Bill, and no offence, mind ye; there's but hundreds of them Parliament folk\n",
      "as wear so many shirts to their back; but there's thousands and thousands o' poor weavers as han\n",
      "only gotten one shirt i' th' world; ay, and don't know where t' get another when that rag's done,\n",
      "though they're turning out miles o' calico every day; and many a mile o't is lying in warehouses,\n",
      "stopping up trade for want o' purchasers. Yo take my advice, John Barton, and ask Parliament to set\n",
      "trade free, so as workmen can earn a decent wage, and buy their two, ay and three, shirts a-year;\n",
      "that would make weaving brisk.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He put his pipe in his mouth again, and redoubled his puffing to make up for lost time.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm afeard, neighbours,\" said John Barton, \"I've not much chance o' telling 'em all yo say; what\n",
      "I think on, is just speaking out about the distress that they say is nought. When they hear o'\n",
      "children born on wet flags, without a rag t' cover 'em, or a bit o' food for th' mother; when they\n",

      "death come to set 'em free; and when they hear o' all this plague, pestilence, and famine, they'll\n",
      "surely do somewhat wiser for us than we can guess at now. Howe'er, I han no objection, if so be\n",
      "there's an opening, to speak up for what yo say; anyhow, I'll do my best, and yo see now, if better\n",
      "times don't come after Parliament knows all.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Some shook their heads, but more looked cheery; and then one by one dropped off, leaving John and\n",
      "his daughter alone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Didst thou mark how poorly Jane Wilson looked?\" asked he, as they wound up their hard day's work\n",
      "by a supper eaten over the fire, which glowed and glimmered through the room, and formed their only\n",
      "light.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, I can't say as I did. But she's never rightly held up her head since the twins died; and all\n",

      "<p>\"What accident, father?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She cotched <ref target=\"#footnote25\">[25]</ref> her side again a wheel. It were afore wheels\n",
      "were boxed up. It were just when she were to have been married, and many a one thought George would\n",
      "ha' been off his bargain; but I knew he wern't the chap for that trick. Pretty near the first place\n",

      "e'er he could, not to hurry her, though there were plenty enow of rude lads to cast their jests at\n",
      "him and her. Her face were white like a sheet when she came in church, but afore she got to th'\n",
      "altar she were all one flush. But for a' that it's been a happy marriage, and George has stuck by me\n",
      "through life like a brother. He'll never hold up his head again if he loses Jane. I didn't like her\n",

      "<p>And so he went to bed, the fear of forthcoming sorrow to his friend mingling with his thoughts of\n",

      "shade them from the bright slanting rays of the morning sun, and then she turned into the house to\n",
      "arrange its disorder before going to her work. She wondered if she should like or dislike the\n",
      "evening and morning solitude; for several hours when the clock struck she thought of her father, and\n",
      "wondered where he was; she made good resolutions according to her lights; and by-and-bye came the\n",
      "distractions and events of the broad full day to occupy her with the present, and to deaden the\n",

      "<p>One of Mary's resolutions was, that she would not be persuaded or induced to see Mr. Harry Carson\n",

      "<p>Now, amongst Miss Simmonds' young ladies was one who had been from the beginning a confidant in\n",
      "Mary's love affair, made so by Mr. Carson himself. He had felt the necessity of some third person to\n",
      "carry letters and messages, and to plead his cause when he was absent. In a girl named Sally\n",
      "Leadbitter he had found a willing advocate. She would have been willing to have embarked in a\n",
      "love-affair herself (especially a clandestine one), for the mere excitement of the thing; but her\n",

      "thought, to become a heroine on her own account. But what she lacked in beauty she tried to make up\n",
      "for by a kind of witty boldness, which gave her what her betters would have called piquancy.\n",
      "Considerations of modesty or propriety never checked her utterance of a good thing. She had just\n",
      "talent enough to corrupt others. Her very good-nature was an evil influence. They could not hate one\n",
      "who was so kind; they could not avoid one who was so willing to shield them from scrapes by any\n",
      "exertion of her own; whose ready fingers would at any time make up for their deficiencies, and whose\n",
      "still more convenient tongue would at any time invent for them. The Jews, or Mohammedans (I forget\n",

      "recount the events of the day, to turn them into ridicule, and to mimic, with admirable fidelity,\n",
      "any person gifted with an absurdity who had fallen under her keen eye. But the mother was lightly\n",
      "principled like Sally herself; nor was there need to conceal from her the reason why Mr. Carson gave\n",

      "<p>Still neither she, nor her daughter, nor Harry Carson liked this resolution of Mary, not to see\n",

      "And she, the weakly, was left behind while the strong man was taken. At any rate the sorrow her\n",
      "father had so feared for him was spared. Such were the thoughts which came over her.</p>\n",
      "<p>She could not go to comfort the bereaved, even if comfort were in her power to give; for she had\n",

      "<p>And in this shock of grief, Sally Leadbitter was the last person she wished to see. However, she\n",

      "<p>\"If you like,\" replied Mary. \"I'm sure I don't care for that or any thing else now;\" weeping\n",
      "afresh.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Sally did not like to be the bearer of any such news. She saw she had gone on the wrong tack,\n",

      "dazzled and lured by gold, even without the betraying love which she believed to exist in Mary's\n",
      "heart. So she urged young Mr. Carson, by representations of the want she was sure surrounded Mary,\n",
      "to bring matters more to a point. But he had a kind of instinctive dread of hurting Mary's pride of\n",

      "in the long run; for he knew he was handsome, and believed himself fascinating.</p>\n",
      "<p>If he had known what Mary's home was, he would not have been so much convinced of his increasing\n",
      "influence over her, by her being more and more ready to linger with him in the sweet summer air. For\n",
      "when she returned for the night her father was often out, and the house wanted the cheerful look it\n",
      "had had in the days when money was never wanted to purchase soap and brushes, black-lead and\n",
      "pipe-clay. It was dingy and comfortless; for, of course, there was not even the dumb familiar\n",
      "home-friend, a fire. And Margaret, too, was now so often from home, singing at some of those grand\n",
      "places. And Alice; oh, Mary wished she had never left her cellar to go and live at Ancoats with her\n",
      "sister-in-law. For in that matter Mary felt very guilty; she had put off and put off going to see\n",
      "the widow after George Wilson's death from dread of meeting Jem, or giving him reason to think she\n",
      "wished to be as intimate with him as formerly; and now she was so much ashamed of her delay that she\n",
      "was likely never to go at all.</p>\n",
      "<p>If her father was at home it was no better; indeed it was worse. He seldom spoke, less than ever;\n",
      "and often when he did speak they were sharp angry words, such as he had never given her formerly.\n",
      "Her temper was high, too, and her answers not over-mild; and once in his passion he had even beaten\n",
      "her. If Sally Leadbitter or Mr. Carson had been at hand at that moment, Mary would have been ready\n",
      "to leave home for ever. She sat alone, after her father had flung out of the house, bitterly\n",
      "thinking on the days that were gone; angry with her own hastiness, and believing that her father did\n",
      "not love her; striving to heap up one painful thought on another. Who cared for her? Mr. Carson\n",
      "might, but in this grief that seemed no comfort. Mother dead! Father so often angry, so lately cruel\n",
      "(for it was a hard blow, and blistered and reddened Mary's soft white skin with pain): and then her\n",
      "heart turned round, and she remembered with self-reproach how provokingly she had looked and spoken,\n",
      "and how much her father had to bear; and oh, what a kind and loving parent he had been, till these\n",
      "days of trial. The remembrance of one little instance of his fatherly love thronged after another\n",
      "into her mind, and she began to wonder how she could have behaved to him as she had done.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then he came home; and but for very shame she would have confessed her penitence in words. But\n",
      "she looked sullen, from her effort to keep down emotion; and for some time her father did not know\n",
      "how to begin to speak. At length he gulped down pride, and said:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary, I'm not above saying I'm very sorry I beat thee. Thou wert a bit aggravating, and I'm not\n",
      "the man I was. But it were wrong, and I'll try never to lay hands on thee again.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So he held out his arms, and in many tears she told him her repentance for her fault. He never\n",
      "struck her again.</p>\n",
      "<p>Still, he often was angry. But that was almost better than being silent. Then he sat near the\n",
      "fire-place (from habit), smoking, or chewing opium. Oh, how Mary loathed that smell! And in the\n",
      "dusk, just before it merged into the short summer night, she had learned to look with dread towards\n",
      "the window, which now her father would have kept uncurtained; for there were not seldom seen sights\n",
      "which haunted her in her dreams. Strange faces of pale men, with dark glaring eyes, peered into the\n",
      "inner darkness, and seemed desirous to ascertain if her father were at home. Or a hand and arm (the\n",
      "body hidden) was put within the door, and beckoned him away. He always went. And once or twice, when\n",
      "Mary was in bed, she heard men's voices below, in earnest, whispered talk.</p>\n",
      "<p>They were all desperate members of Trades' Unions, ready for any thing; made ready by want.</p>\n",
      "<p>While all this change for gloom yet struck fresh and heavy on Mary's heart, her father startled\n",
      "her out of a reverie one evening, by asking her when she had been to see Jane Wilson. From his\n",
      "manner of speaking, she was made aware that he had been; but at the time of his visit he had never\n",
      "mentioned any thing about it. Now, however, he gruffly told her to go next day without fail, and\n",
      "added some abuse of her for not having been before. The little outward impulse of her father's\n",
      "speech gave Mary the push which she, in this instance, required; and, accordingly, timing her visit\n",
      "so as to avoid Jem's hours at home, she went the following afternoon to Ancoats.</p>\n",
      "<p>The outside of the well-known house struck her as different; for the door was closed, instead of\n",
      "open, as it once had always stood. The window-plants, George Wilson's pride and especial care,\n",
      "looked withering and drooping. They had been without water for a long time, and now, when the widow\n",
      "had reproached herself severely for neglect, in her ignorant anxiety, she gave them too much. On\n",
      "opening the door, Alice was seen, not stirring about in her habitual way, but knitting by the\n",
      "fire-side. The room felt hot, although the fire burnt gray and dim, under the bright rays of the\n",
      "afternoon sun. Mrs. Wilson was \"siding\" <ref target=\"#footnote39\">[39]</ref> the dinner things, and\n",
      "talking all the time, in a kind of whining, shouting voice, which Mary did not at first understand.\n",
      "She understood at once, however, that her absence had been noted, and talked over; she saw a\n",
      "constrained look on Mrs. Wilson's sorrow-stricken face, which told her a scolding was to come.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear Mary, is that you?\" she began. \"Why, who would ha' dreamt of seeing you! We thought you'd\n",
      "clean forgotten us; and Jem has often wondered if he should know you, if he met you in the\n",
      "street.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, poor Jane Wilson had been sorely tried; and at present her trials had had no outward effect,\n",
      "but that of increased acerbity of temper. She wished to show Mary how much she was offended, and\n",
      "meant to strengthen her cause, by putting some of her own sharp speeches into Jem's mouth.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary felt guilty, and had no good reason to give as an apology; so for a minute she stood silent,\n",
      "looking very much ashamed, and then turned to speak to aunt Alice, who, in her surprised, hearty\n",
      "greeting to Mary, had dropped her ball of worsted, and was busy trying to set the thread to rights,\n",
      "before the kitten had entangled it past redemption, once round every chair, and twice round the\n",
      "table.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You mun speak louder than that, if you mean her to hear; she become as deaf as a post this last\n",

      "<p>\"Yes, my dear, I'm getting very hard o' hearing of late,\" said Alice, catching the state of the\n",
      "case, with her quick-glancing eyes. \"I suppose it's the beginning of th' end.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't talk o' that way,\" screamed her sister-in-law. \"We've had enow of ends and deaths without\n",
      "forecasting more.\" She covered her face with her apron, and sat down to cry.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He was such a good husband,\" said she, in a less excited tone, to Mary, as she looked up with\n",
      "tear-streaming eyes from behind her apron. \"No one can tell what I've lost in him, for no one knew\n",
      "his worth like me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary's listening sympathy softened her, and she went on to unburden her heavy laden heart.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Eh, dear, dear! No one knows what I've lost. When my poor boys went, I thought th' Almighty had\n",
      "crushed me to th' ground, but I never thought o' losing George; I did na think I could ha' borne to\n",

      "a dinner fit for a prince.' I were anxious to make him comfortable, God knows how anxious. And yet\n",
      "I'd no notion how to cook a potato. I know'd they were boiled, and I know'd their skins were taken\n",
      "off, and that were all. So I tidyed my house in a rough kind o' way, and then I looked at that very\n",

      "<p>\"Jem's getten on rarely,\" said Alice, who had not heard her sister's last burst of eloquence, and\n",

      "<p>The splendid red and yellow patch quilt now made its appearance, and Jane Wilson would not be\n",
      "satisfied unless Mary praised it all over, border, centre, and ground-work, right side and wrong;\n",
      "and Mary did her duty, saying all the more, because she could not work herself up to any very hearty\n",
      "admiration of her rival's present. She made haste, however, with her commendations, in order to\n",
      "avoid encountering Jem. As soon as she was fairly away from the house and street, she slackened her\n",
      "pace, and began to think. Did Jem really care for Molly Gibson? Well, if he did, let him. People\n",
      "seemed all to think he was much too good for her (Mary's own self). Perhaps some one else, far more\n",
      "handsome, and far more grand, would show him one day that she was good enough to be Mrs. Henry\n",
      "Carson. So temper, or what Mary called \"spirit,\" led her to encourage Mr. Carson more than ever she\n",
      "had done before.</p>\n",
      "<p>Some weeks after this, there was a meeting of the Trades' Union to which John Barton belonged.\n",
      "The morning of the day on which it was to take place he had lain late in bed, for what was the use\n",
      "of getting up? He had hesitated between the purchase of meal or opium, and had chosen the latter,\n",
      "for its use had become a necessity with him. He wanted it to relieve him from the terrible\n",
      "depression its absence occasioned. A large lump seemed only to bring him into a natural state, or\n",
      "what had been his natural state formerly. Eight o'clock was the hour fixed for the meeting; and at\n",
      "it were read letters, filled with details of woe, from all parts of the country. Fierce, heavy gloom\n",
      "brooded over the assembly; and fiercely and heavily did the men separate, towards eleven o'clock,\n",
      "some irritated by the opposition of others to their desperate plans.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was not a night to cheer them, as they quitted the glare of the gas-lighted room, and came out\n",
      "into the street. Unceasing, soaking rain was falling; the very lamps seemed obscured by the damp\n",
      "upon the glass, and their light reached but to a little distance from the posts. The streets were\n",
      "cleared of passers-by; not a creature seemed stirring, except here and there a drenched policeman in\n",
      "his oil-skin cape. Barton wished the others good night, and set off home. He had gone through a\n",
      "street or two, when he heard a step behind him; but he did not care to look and see who it was. A\n",
      "little further, and the person quickened step, and touched his arm very lightly. He turned, and saw,\n",
      "even by the darkness visible of that badly-lighted street, that the woman who stood by him was of no\n",
      "doubtful profession. It was told by her faded finery, all unfit to meet the pelting of that pitiless\n",
      "storm; the gauze bonnet, once pink, now dirty white; the muslin gown, all draggled, and soaking wet\n",
      "up to the very knees; the gay-coloured barège shawl, closely wrapped round the form, which yet\n",
      "shivered and shook, as the woman whispered: \"I want to speak to you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He swore an oath, and bade her begone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I really do. Don't send me away. I'm so out of breath, I cannot say what I would all at once.\"\n",
      "She put her hand to her side, and caught her breath with evident pain.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I tell thee I'm not the man for thee,\" adding an opprobrious name. \"Stay,\" said he, as a thought\n",
      "suggested by her voice flashed across him. He gripped her arm—the arm he had just before shaken off,\n",
      "and dragged her, faintly resisting, to the nearest lamp-post. He pushed her bonnet back, and roughly\n",
      "held the face she would fain have averted, to the light, and in her large, unnaturally bright gray\n",
      "eyes, her lovely mouth, half open, as if imploring the forbearance she could not ask for in words,\n",
      "he saw at once the long-lost Esther; she who had caused his wife's death. Much was like the gay\n",
      "creature of former years; but the glaring paint, the sharp features, the changed expression of the\n",
      "whole! But most of all, he loathed the dress; and yet the poor thing, out of her little choice of\n",
      "attire, had put on the plainest she had, to come on that night's errand.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So it's thee, is it! It's thee!\" exclaimed John, as he ground his teeth, and shook her with\n",
      "passion. \"I've looked for thee long at corners o' streets, and such like places. I knew I should\n",
      "find thee at last. Thee'll may be bethink thee o' some words I spoke, which put thee up at th' time;\n",
      "summut about street-walkers; but oh no! thou art none o' them naughts; no one thinks thou art, who\n",
      "sees thy fine draggle-tailed dress, and thy pretty pink cheeks!\" stopping for very want of\n",
      "breath.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, mercy! John, mercy! listen to me for Mary's sake!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She meant his daughter, but the name only fell on his ear as belonging to his wife; and it was\n",
      "adding fuel to the fire. In vain did her face grow deadly pale round the vivid circle of paint, in\n",
      "vain did she gasp for mercy,—he burst forth again.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And thou names that name to me! and thou thinks the thought of her will bring thee mercy! Dost\n",
      "thou know it was thee who killed her, as sure as ever Cain killed Abel. She'd loved thee as her own,\n",
      "and she trusted thee as her own, and when thou wert gone she never held up head again, but died in\n",
      "less than a three week; and at the judgment day she'll rise, and point to thee as her murderer; or\n",
      "if she don't, I will.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He flung her, trembling, sickening, fainting, from him, and strode away. She fell with a feeble\n",
      "scream against the lamp-post, and lay there in her weakness, unable to rise. A policeman came up in\n",
      "time to see the close of these occurrences, and concluding from Esther's unsteady, reeling fall,\n",
      "that she was tipsy, he took her in her half-unconscious state to the lock-ups for the night. The\n",
      "superintendent of that abode of vice and misery was roused from his dozing watch through the dark\n",
      "hours, by half-delirious wails and moanings, which he reported as arising from intoxication. If he\n",
      "had listened, he would have heard these words, repeated in various forms, but always in the same\n",
      "anxious, muttering way.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He would not listen to me; what can I do? He would not listen to me, and I wanted to warn him!\n",
      "Oh, what shall I do to save Mary's child? What shall I do? How can I keep her from being such a one\n",
      "as I am; such a wretched, loathsome creature! She was listening just as I listened, and loving just\n",
      "as I loved, and the end will be just like my end. How shall I save her? She won't hearken to\n",
      "warning, or heed it more than I did; and who loves her well enough to watch over her as she should\n",
      "be watched? God keep her from harm! And yet I won't pray for her; sinner that I am! Can my prayers\n",
      "be heard? No! they'll only do harm. How shall I save her? He would not listen to me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So the night wore away. The next morning she was taken up to the New Bailey. It was a clear case\n",

      "<p>He often looked at Mary, and wished she were not so like her aunt, for the very bodily likeness\n",
      "seemed to suggest the possibility of a similar likeness in their fate; and then this idea enraged\n",

      "been so remarkably free from all control, and almost from all inquiry concerning her actions, that\n",
      "she did not brook this change in her father's behaviour very well. Just when she was yielding more\n",
      "than ever to Mr. Carson's desire of frequent meetings, it was hard to be so questioned concerning\n",
      "her hours of leaving off work, whether she had come straight home, &amp;c. She could not tell lies;\n",
      "though she could conceal much if she were not questioned. So she took refuge in obstinate silence,\n",
      "alleging as a reason for it her indignation at being so cross-examined. This did not add to the good\n",

      "one principal reason for maintaining such behaviour as displeased the other, was the believing that\n",

      "<p>Her father now began to wish Mary were married. Then this terrible superstitious fear suggested\n",
      "by her likeness to Esther would be done away with. He felt that he could not resume the reins he had\n",
      "once slackened. But with a husband it would be different. If Jem Wilson would but marry her! With\n",

      "desperate fond o' thee, or I'm much mistaken. Much fonder of thee than thou deservedst.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's as people think,\" said Mary, pertly, for she remembered that the very morning before she\n",
      "had met Mr. Carson, who had sighed, and swore, and protested all manner of tender vows that she was\n",
      "the loveliest, sweetest, best, &amp;c. And when she had seen him afterwards riding with one of his\n",

      "attention and interest, and then lingered behind his sister's horse for a moment to kiss his hand\n",
      "repeatedly. So, as for Jem Wilson, she could whistle him down the wind.</p>\n",

      "<p>It so happened that Jem, after much anxious thought, had determined that day to \"put his fate to\n",

      "his mother and aunt must form part of the household; but such is not an uncommon case among the\n",
      "poor, and if there were the advantage of previous friendship between the parties, it was not, he\n",

      "a certainty of happiness the idea of that welcome implied.</p>\n",
      "<p>He had been absent and abstracted all day long with the thought of the coming event of the\n",

      "to earn a few pence by working over hours at some mourning.</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem entered, looking more awkward and abashed than he had ever done before. Yet here was Mary all\n",
      "alone, just as he had hoped to find her. She did not ask him to take a chair, but after standing a\n",
      "minute or two he sat down near her.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is your father at home, Mary?\" said he, by way of making an opening, for she seemed determined\n",
      "to keep silence, and went on stitching away.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, he's gone to his Union, I suppose.\" Another silence. It was no use waiting, thought Jem. The\n",
      "subject would never be led to by any talk he could think of in his anxious fluttered state. He had\n",
      "better begin at once.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary!\" said he, and the unusual tone of his voice made her look up for an instant, but in that\n",
      "time she understood from his countenance what was coming, and her heart beat so suddenly and\n",
      "violently she could hardly sit still. Yet one thing she was sure of; nothing he could say should\n",
      "make her have him. She would show them all <hi>who</hi> would be glad to have her. She was not yet\n",
      "calm after her father's irritating speeches. Yet her eyes fell veiled before that passionate look\n",
      "fixed upon her.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear Mary! (for how dear you are, I cannot rightly tell you in words). It's no new story I'm\n",
      "going to speak about. You must ha' seen and known it long; for since we were boy and girl, I ha'\n",
      "loved you above father and mother and all; and all I've thought on by day and dreamt on by night,\n",
      "has been something in which you've had a share. I'd no way of keeping you for long, and I scorned to\n",
      "try and tie you down; and I lived in terror lest some one else should take you to himself. But now,\n",
      "Mary, I'm foreman in th' works, and, dear Mary! listen,\" as she, in her unbearable agitation, stood\n",
      "up and turned away from him. He rose, too, and came nearer, trying to take hold of her hand; but\n",
      "this she would not allow. She was bracing herself up to refuse him, for once and for all.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And now, Mary, I've a home to offer you, and a heart as true as ever man had to love you and\n",
      "cherish you; we shall never be rich folk, I dare say; but if a loving heart and a strong right arm\n",
      "can shield you from sorrow, or from want, mine shall do it. I cannot speak as I would like; my love\n",
      "won't let itself be put in words. But oh! darling, say you believe me, and that you'll be mine.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She could not speak at once; her words would not come.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary, they say silence gives consent; is it so?\" he whispered.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now or never the effort must be made.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! it does not with me.\" Her voice was calm, although she trembled from head to foot. \"I will\n",
      "always be your friend, Jem, but I can never be your wife.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not my wife!\" said he, mournfully. \"Oh Mary, think awhile! you cannot be my friend if you will\n",
      "not be my wife. At least I can never be content to be only your friend. Do think awhile! If you say\n",
      "No you will make me hopeless, desperate. It's no love of yesterday. It has made the very groundwork\n",
      "of all that people call good in me. I don't know what I shall be if you won't have me. And, Mary!\n",
      "think how glad your father would be! it may sound vain, but he's told me more than once how much he\n",
      "should like to see us two married!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem intended this for a powerful argument, but in Mary's present mood it told against him more\n",
      "than any thing; for it suggested the false and foolish idea, that her father, in his evident anxiety\n",
      "to promote her marriage with Jem, had been speaking to him on the subject with some degree of\n",
      "solicitation.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I tell you, Jem, it cannot be. Once for all, I will never marry you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And is this the end of all my hopes and fears? the end of my life, I may say, for it is the end\n",
      "of all worth living for!\" His agitation rose and carried him into passion. \"Mary! you'll hear, may\n",
      "be, of me as a drunkard, and may be as a thief, and may be as a murderer. Remember! when all are\n",
      "speaking ill of me, you will have no right to blame me, for it's your cruelty that will have made me\n",
      "what I feel I shall become. You won't even say you'll try and like me; will you, Mary?\" said he,\n",
      "suddenly changing his tone from threatening despair to fond passionate entreaty, as he took her hand\n",
      "and held it forcibly between both of his, while he tried to catch a glimpse of her averted face. She\n",
      "was silent, but it was from deep and violent emotion. He could not bear to wait; he would not hope,\n",
      "to be dashed away again; he rather in his bitterness of heart chose the certainty of despair, and\n",
      "before she could resolve what to answer, he flung away her hand and rushed out of the house.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem! Jem!\" cried she, with faint and choking voice. It was too late; he left street after street\n",
      "behind him with his almost winged speed, as he sought the fields, where he might give way unobserved\n",
      "to all the deep despair he felt.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was scarcely ten minutes since he had entered the house, and found Mary at comparative peace,\n",
      "and now she lay half across the dresser, her head hidden in her hands, and every part of her body\n",
      "shaking with the violence of her sobs. She could not have told at first (if you had asked her, and\n",
      "she could have commanded voice enough to answer) why she was in such agonised grief. It was too\n",
      "sudden for her to analyse, or think upon it. She only felt that by her own doing her life would be\n",
      "hereafter dreary and blank. By-and-bye her sorrow exhausted her body by its power, and she seemed to\n",
      "have no strength left for crying. She sat down; and now thoughts crowded on her mind. One little\n",
      "hour ago, and all was still unsaid, and she had her fate in her own power. And yet, how long ago had\n",
      "she determined to say pretty much what she did, if the occasion ever offered.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was as if two people were arguing the matter; that mournful, desponding communion between her\n",
      "former self and her present self. Herself, a day, an hour ago; and herself now. For we have every\n",
      "one of us felt how a very few minutes of the months and years called life, will sometimes suffice to\n",
      "place all time past and future in an entirely new light; will make us see the vanity or the\n",
      "criminality of the bye-gone, and so change the aspect of the coming time, that we look with loathing\n",
      "on the very thing we have most desired. A few moments may change our character for life, by giving a\n",
      "totally different direction to our aims and energies.</p>\n",
      "<p>To return to Mary. Her plan had been, as we well know, to marry Mr. Carson, and the occurrence an\n",
      "hour ago was only a preliminary step. True; but it had unveiled her heart to her; it had convinced\n",
      "her she loved Jem above all persons or things. But Jem was a poor mechanic, with a mother and aunt\n",
      "to keep; a mother, too, who had shown her pretty clearly she did not desire her for a\n",
      "daughter-in-law: while Mr. Carson was rich, and prosperous, and gay, and (she believed) would place\n",
      "her in all circumstances of ease and luxury, where want could never come. What were these hollow\n",
      "vanities to her, now she had discovered the passionate secret of her soul? She felt as if she almost\n",
      "hated Mr. Carson, who had decoyed her with his baubles. She now saw how vain, how nothing to her,\n",
      "would be all gaieties and pomps, all joys and pleasures, unless she might share them with Jem; yes,\n",
      "with him she harshly rejected so short a time ago. If he were poor, she loved him all the better. If\n",
      "his mother did think her unworthy of him, what was it but the truth, as she now owned with bitter\n",
      "penitence. She had hitherto been walking in grope-light towards a precipice; but in the clear\n",
      "revelation of that past hour, she saw her danger, and turned away resolutely and for ever.</p>\n",
      "<p>That was some comfort: I mean her clear perception of what she ought not to do; of what no luring\n",
      "temptation should ever again induce her to hearken to. How she could best undo the wrong she had\n",
      "done to Jem and herself by refusing his love, was another anxious question. She wearied herself with\n",
      "proposing plans, and rejecting them.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was roused to a consciousness of time by hearing the neighbouring church clock strike twelve.\n",
      "Her father she knew might be expected home any minute, and she was in no mood for a meeting with\n",
      "him. So she hastily gathered up her work, and went to her own little bed-room, leaving him to let\n",
      "himself in.</p>\n",
      "<p>She put out her candle, that her father might not see its light under the door; and sat down on\n",
      "her bed to think. But after turning things over in her mind again and again, she could only\n",
      "determine at once to put an end to all further communication with Mr. Carson, in the most decided\n",
      "way she could. Maidenly modesty (and true love is ever modest) seemed to oppose every plan she could\n",
      "think of, for showing Jem how much she repented her decision against him, and how dearly she had now\n",
      "discovered that she loved him. She came to the unusual wisdom of resolving to do nothing, but try\n",
      "and be patient, and improve circumstances as they might turn up. Surely, if Jem knew of her\n",
      "remaining unmarried, he would try his fortune again. He would never be content with one rejection;\n",
      "she believed she could not in his place. She had been very wrong, but now she would try and do\n",
      "right, and have womanly patience, until he saw her changed and repentant mind in her natural\n",
      "actions. Even if she had to wait for years, it was no more than now it was easy to look forward to,\n",
      "as a penance for her giddy flirting on the one hand, and her cruel mistake concerning her feelings\n",
      "on the other. So anticipating a happy ending to the course of her love, however distant it might be,\n",
      "she fell asleep just as the earliest factory bells were ringing. She had sunk down in her clothes,\n",
      "and her sleep was unrefreshing. She wakened up shivery and chill in body, and sorrow-stricken in\n",
      "mind, though she could not at first rightly tell the cause of her depression.</p>\n",
      "<p>She recalled the events of the night before, and still resolved to adhere to those determinations\n",
      "she had then formed. But patience seemed a far more difficult virtue this morning.</p>\n",
      "<p>She hastened down-stairs, and in her earnest sad desire to do right, now took much pains to\n",
      "secure a comfortable though scanty breakfast for her father; and when he dawdled into the room, in\n",
      "an evidently irritable temper, she bore all with the gentleness of penitence, till at last her mild\n",
      "answers turned away wrath.</p>\n",
      "<p>She loathed the idea of meeting Sally Leadbitter at her daily work; yet it must be done, and she\n",
      "tried to nerve herself for the encounter, and to make it at once understood, that having determined\n",
      "to give up having any thing further to do with Mr. Carson, she considered the bond of intimacy\n",
      "broken between them.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Sally was not the person to let these resolutions be carried into effect too easily. She soon\n",
      "became aware of the present state of Mary's feelings, but she thought they merely arose from the\n",
      "changeableness of girlhood, and that the time would come when Mary would thank her for almost\n",
      "forcing her to keep up her meetings and communications with her rich lover.</p>\n",
      "<p>So, when two days had passed over in rather too marked avoidance of Sally on Mary's part, and\n",
      "when the former was made aware by Mr. Carson's complaints that Mary was not keeping her appointments\n",
      "with him, and that unless he detained her by force, he had no chance of obtaining a word as she\n",
      "passed him in the street on her rapid walk home, she resolved to compel Mary to what she called her\n",
      "own good.</p>\n",
      "<p>She took no notice during the third day of Mary's avoidance as they sat at work; she rather\n",
      "seemed to acquiesce in the coolness of their intercourse. She put away her sewing early, and went\n",
      "home to her mother, who, she said, was more ailing than usual. The other girls soon followed her\n",
      "example, and Mary, casting a rapid glance up and down the street, as she stood last on Miss\n",
      "Simmonds' door-step, darted homewards, in hopes of avoiding the person whom she was fast learning to\n",
      "dread. That night she was safe from any encounter on her road, and she arrived at home, which she\n",
      "found as she expected, empty; for she knew it was a club night, which her father would not miss. She\n",
      "sat down to recover breath, and to still her heart, which panted more from nervousness than from\n",
      "over-exertion, although she had walked so quickly. Then she rose, and taking off her bonnet, her eye\n",
      "caught the form of Sally Leadbitter passing the window with a lingering step, and looking into the\n",
      "darkness with all her might, as if to ascertain if Mary were returned. In an instant she re-passed\n",
      "and knocked at the house-door, but without awaiting an answer, she entered.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Mary, dear\" (knowing well how little \"dear\" Mary considered her just then); \"i's so\n",
      "difficult to get any comfortable talk at Miss Simmonds', I thought I'd just step up and see you at\n",
      "home.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I understood from what you said your mother was ailing, and that you wanted to be with her,\"\n",
      "replied Mary, in no welcoming tone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, but mother's better now,\" said the unabashed Sally. \"Your father's out I suppose?\" looking\n",
      "round as well as she could; for Mary made no haste to perform the hospitable offices of striking a\n",
      "match, and lighting a candle.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, he's out,\" said Mary, shortly, and busying herself at last about the candle, without ever\n",
      "asking her visitor to sit down.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So much the better,\" answered Sally, \"for to tell you the truth, Mary, I've a friend at th' end\n",
      "of the street, as is anxious to come and see you at home, since you're grown so particular as not to\n",
      "like to speak to him in the street. He'll be here directly.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Sally, don't let him,\" said Mary, speaking at last heartily; and running to the door she\n",
      "would have fastened it, but Sally held her hands, laughing meanwhile at her distress.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, please, Sally,\" struggling, \"dear Sally! don't let him come here, the neighbours will so\n",
      "talk, and father'll go mad if he hears; he'll kill me, Sally, he will. Besides, I don't love him—I\n",
      "never did. Oh, let me go,\" as footsteps approached; and then, as they passed the house, and seemed\n",
      "to give her a respite, she continued, \"Do, Sally, dear Sally, go and tell him I don't love him, and\n",
      "that I don't want to have any thing more to do with him. It was very wrong, I dare say, keeping\n",
      "company with him at all, but I'm very sorry, if I've led him to think too much of me; and I don't\n",
      "want him to think any more. Will you tell him this, Sally? and I'll do any thing for you if you\n",
      "will.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" said Sally, in a more relenting mood, \"I'll go back with you to\n",
      "where he's waiting for us; or rather, I should say, where I told him to wait for a quarter of an\n",
      "hour, till I seed if your father was at home; and if I didn't come back in that time, he said he'd\n",
      "come here, and break the door open but he'd see you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, let us go, let us go,\" said Mary, feeling that the interview must be, and had better be\n",
      "anywhere than at home, where her father might return at any minute. She snatched up her bonnet, and\n",
      "was at the end of the court in an instant; but then, not knowing whether to turn to the right or to\n",
      "the left, she was obliged to wait for Sally, who came leisurely up, and put her arm through Mary's,\n",
      "with a kind of decided hold, intended to prevent the possibility of her changing her mind, and\n",
      "turning back. But this, under the circumstances, was quite different to Mary's plan. She had\n",
      "wondered more than once if she must not have another interview with Mr. Carson; and had then\n",
      "determined, while she expressed her resolution that it should be the final one, to tell him how\n",
      "sorry she was if she had thoughtlessly given him false hopes. For be it remembered, she had the\n",
      "innocence, or the ignorance, to believe his intentions honourable; and he, feeling that at any price\n",
      "he must have her, only that he would obtain her as cheaply as he could, had never undeceived her;\n",
      "while Sally Leadbitter laughed in her sleeve at them both, and wondered how it would all\n",
      "end,—whether Mary would gain her point of marriage, with her sly affectation of believing such to be\n",
      "Mr. Carson's intention in courting her.</p>\n",
      "<p>Not very far from the end of the street, into which the court where Mary lived opened, they met\n",
      "Mr. Carson, his hat a good deal slouched over his face as if afraid of being recognised. He turned\n",
      "when he saw them coming, and led the way without uttering a word (although they were close behind)\n",
      "to a street of half-finished houses.</p>\n",
      "<p>The length of the walk gave Mary time to recoil from the interview which was to follow; but even\n",
      "if her own resolve to go through with it had failed, there was the steady grasp of Sally Leadbitter,\n",
      "which she could not evade without an absolute struggle.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last he stopped in the shelter and concealment of a wooden fence, put up to keep the building\n",
      "rubbish from intruding on the foot-pavement. Inside this fence, a minute afterwards, the girls were\n",
      "standing by him; Mary now returning Sally's detaining grasp with interest, for she had determined on\n",
      "the way to make her a witness, willing or unwilling, to the ensuing conversation. But Sally's\n",
      "curiosity led her to be a very passive prisoner in Mary's hold.</p>\n",
      "<p>With more freedom than he had ever used before, Mr. Carson put his arm firmly round Mary's waist,\n",
      "in spite of her indignant resistance.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay, nay! you little witch! Now I have caught you, I shall keep you prisoner. Tell me now what\n",
      "has made you run away from me so fast these few days—tell me, you sweet little coquette!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary ceased struggling, but turned so as to be almost opposite to him, while she spoke out calmly\n",
      "and boldly,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mr. Carson! I want to speak to you for once and for all. Since I met you last Monday evening, I\n",
      "have made up my mind to have nothing more to do with you. I know I've been wrong in leading you to\n",
      "think I liked you; but I believe I didn't rightly know my own mind; and I humbly beg your pardon,\n",
      "sir, if I've led you to think too much of me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>For an instant he was surprised; the next, vanity came to his aid, and convinced him that she\n",
      "could only be joking. He, young, agreeable, rich, handsome! No! she was only showing a little\n",
      "womanly fondness for coquetting.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You're a darling little rascal to go on in this way! 'Humbly begging my pardon if you've made me\n",
      "think too much of you.' As if you didn't know I think of you from morning to night. But you want to\n",
      "be told it again and again, do you?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, indeed, sir, I don't. I would far liefer <ref target=\"#footnote40\">[40]</ref> that you\n",
      "should say you will never think of me again, than that you should speak of me in this way. For\n",
      "indeed, sir, I never was more in earnest than I am, when I say to-night is the last night I will\n",
      "ever speak to you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Last night, you sweet little equivocator, but not last day. Ha, Mary! I've caught you, have I?\"\n",
      "as she, puzzled by his perseverance in thinking her joking, hesitated in what form she could now put\n",
      "her meaning.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I mean, sir,\" she said, sharply, \"that I will never speak to you again at any time, after\n",
      "to-night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And what's made this change, Mary?\" said he, seriously enough now. \"Have I done any thing to\n",
      "offend you?\" added he, earnestly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, sir,\" she answered gently, but yet firmly. \"I cannot tell you exactly why I've changed my\n",
      "mind; but I shall not alter it again; and as I said before, I beg your pardon if I've done wrong by\n",
      "you. And now, sir, if you please, good night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But I do not please. You shall not go. What have I done, Mary? Tell me. You must not go without\n",
      "telling me how I have vexed you. What would you have me do?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nothing, sir! but (in an agitated tone) oh! let me go! You cannot change my mind; it's quite\n",
      "made up. Oh, sir! why do you hold me so tight? If you <hi>will</hi> know why I won't have any thing\n",
      "more to do with you, it is that I cannot love you. I have tried, and I really cannot.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>This naive and candid avowal served her but little. He could not understand how it could be true.\n",
      "Some reason lurked behind. He was passionately in love. What should he do to tempt her? A thought\n",
      "struck him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Listen! Mary. Nay, I cannot let you go till you have heard me. I do love you dearly; and I won't\n",
      "believe but what you love me a very little, just a very little. Well, if you don't like to own it,\n",
      "never mind! I only want now to tell you how much I love you, by what I am ready to give up for you.\n",
      "You know (or perhaps you are not fully aware) how little my father and mother would like me to marry\n",
      "you. So angry would they be, and so much ridicule should I have to brave, that of course I have\n",
      "never thought of it till now. I thought we could be happy enough without marriage.\" (Deep sank those\n",
      "words into Mary's heart.) \"But now, if you like, I'll get a licence to-morrow morning—nay, to-night,\n",
      "and I'll marry you in defiance of all the world, rather than give you up. In a year or two my father\n",
      "will forgive me, and meanwhile you shall have every luxury money can purchase, and every charm that\n",
      "love can devise to make your life happy. After all, my mother was but a factory girl.\" (This was\n",
      "said half to himself, as if to reconcile himself to this bold step.) \"Now, Mary, you see how willing\n",
      "I am to—to sacrifice a good deal for you; I even offer you marriage, to satisfy your little\n",
      "ambitious heart; so, now, won't you say you can love me a little, little bit?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He pulled her towards him. To his surprise, she still resisted. Yes! though all she had pictured\n",
      "to herself for so many months in being the wife of Mr. Carson was now within her grasp, she\n",
      "resisted. His speech had given her but one feeling, that of exceeding great relief. For she had\n",
      "dreaded, now she knew what true love was, to think of the attachment she might have created; the\n",
      "deep feeling her flirting conduct might have called out. She had loaded herself with reproaches for\n",
      "the misery she might have caused. It was a relief to gather that the attachment was of that low,\n",
      "despicable kind, which can plan to seduce the object of its affection; that the feeling she had\n",
      "caused was shallow enough, for it only pretended to embrace self, at the expense of the misery, the\n",
      "ruin, of one falsely termed beloved. She need not be penitent to such a plotter! That was the\n",
      "relief.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I am obliged to you, sir, for telling me what you have. You may think I am a fool; but I did\n",
      "think you meant to marry me all along; and yet, thinking so, I felt I could not love you. Still I\n",
      "felt sorry I had gone so far in keeping company with you. Now, sir, I tell you, if I had loved you\n",
      "before, I don't think I should have loved you now you have told me you meant to ruin me; for that's\n",
      "the plain English of not meaning to marry me till just this minute. I said I was sorry, and humbly\n",
      "begged your pardon; that was before I knew what you were. Now I scorn you, sir, for plotting to ruin\n",
      "a poor girl. Good night.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>\"No;\" she answered, faintly and sadly; for Halifax was all the same to her heart as the\n",
      "Antipodes; equally inaccessible by humble penitent looks and maidenly tokens of love.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, he's there, however; he's putting up an engine for some folks there, for his master. He's\n",
      "doing well, for he's getten four or five men under him; we'd two or three meetings, and he telled me\n",

      "<p>\"Well, I thought it all happened afore he left Manchester, and then in course you'd ha' known.\n",

      "quarrelling wi' Jem, surely?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Now Mary cried outright; she was weak in body, and unhappy in mind, and the time was come when\n",
      "she might have the relief of telling her grief. She could not bring herself to confess how much of\n",
      "her sorrow was caused by her having been vain and foolish; she hoped that need never be known, and\n",
      "she could not bear to think of it.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Margaret; do you know Jem came here one night when I were put out, and cross. Oh, dear!\n",
      "dear! I could bite my tongue out when I think on it. And he told me how he loved me, and I thought I\n",
      "did not love him, and I told him I didn't; and, Margaret,—he believed me, and went away so sad, and\n",
      "so angry; and now I'd do any thing,—I would, indeed,\" her sobs choked the end of her sentence.\n",

      "only a temporary estrangement.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tell me, Margaret,\" said Mary, taking her apron down from her eyes, and looking at Margaret with\n",
      "eager anxiety, \"what can I do to bring him back to me? Should I write to him?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No,\" replied her friend, \"that would not do. Men are so queer, they like to have a' the courting\n",

      "<p>\"But I did not mean to write him a courting letter,\" said Mary, somewhat indignantly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If you wrote at all, it would be to give him a hint you'd taken the rue, and would be very glad\n",
      "to have him now. I believe now he'd rather find that out himself.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But he won't try,\" said Mary, sighing. \"How can he find it out when he's at Halifax?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If he's a will he's a way, depend upon it. And you would not have him if he's not a will to you,\n",
      "Mary! No, dear!\" changing her tone from the somewhat hard way in which sensible people too often\n",
      "speak, to the soft accents of tenderness which come with such peculiar grace from them; \"you must\n",
      "just wait and be patient. You may depend upon it, all will end well, and better than if you meddled\n",
      "in it now.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But it's so hard to be patient,\" pleaded Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, dear; being patient is the hardest work we, any on us, have to do through life, I take it.\n",
      "Waiting is far more difficult than doing. I've known that about my sight, and many a one has known\n",

      "a pause. \"Have ye been to see his mother of late?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No; not for some weeks. When last I went she was so frabbit <ref target=\"#footnote42\">[42]</ref>\n",

      "<p>\"Well! if I were you I'd go. Jem will hear on't, and it will do you far more good in his mind\n",
      "than writing a letter, which, after all, you would find a tough piece of work when you came to\n",
      "settle to it. 'Twould be hard to say neither too much nor too little. But I must be going,\n",

      "more money than I can well manage; and, dear, would you just take this bit o' gold, and pay me back\n",
      "in good times?\" The tears stood in Margaret's eyes as she spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear Margaret, we're not so bad pressed as that.\" (The thought of her father, and his ill looks,\n",
      "and his one meal a day, rushed upon Mary.) \"And yet, dear, if it would not put you out o' your\n",
      "way,—I would work hard to make it up to you;—but would not your grandfather be vexed?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not he, wench! It were more his thought than mine, and we have gotten ever so many more at home,\n",
      "so don't hurry yoursel about paying. It's hard to be blind, to be sure, else money comes in so\n",
      "easily now to what it used to do; and it's downright pleasure to earn it, for I do so like\n",
      "singing.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wish I could sing,\" said Mary, looking at the sovereign.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Some has one kind o' gifts, and some another. Many's the time when I could see, that I longed\n",
      "for your beauty, Mary! We're like childer, ever wanting what we han not got. But now I must say just\n",
      "one more word. Remember, if you're sore pressed for money, we shall take it very unkind if you\n",
      "donnot let us know. Good bye to ye.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>In spite of her blindness she hurried away, anxious to rejoin her grandfather, and desirous also\n",
      "to escape from Mary's expressions of gratitude.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her visit had done Mary good in many ways. It had strengthened her patience and her hope. It had\n",
      "given her confidence in Margaret's sympathy; and last, and really least in comforting power (of so\n",
      "little value are silver and gold in comparison to love, that gift in every one's power to bestow),\n",
      "came the consciousness of the money-value of the sovereign she held in her hand. The many things it\n",
      "might purchase! First of all came the thought of a comfortable supper for her father that very\n",
      "night; and acting instantly upon the idea, she set off in hopes that all the provision-shops might\n",
      "not yet be closed, although it was so late.</p>\n",
      "<p>That night the cottage shone with unusual light, and fire-gleam; and the father and daughter sat\n",
      "down to a meal they thought almost extravagant. It was so long since they had had enough to eat.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Food gives heart,\" say the Lancashire people; and the next day Mary made time to go and call on\n",
      "Mrs. Wilson, according to Margaret's advice. She found her quite alone, and more gracious than she\n",
      "had been the last time Mary had visited her. Alice was gone out, she said.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She would just step to the post-office, all for no earthly use. For it were to ask if they\n",
      "hadn't a letter lying there for her from her foster-son Will Wilson, the sailor-lad.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What made her think there were a letter?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, yo see, a neighbour as has been in Liverpool, telled us Will's ship were come in. Now he\n",
      "said last time he were in Liverpool he'd ha' come to ha' seen Alice, but his ship had but a week\n",
      "holiday, and hard work for the men in that time too. So Alice makes sure he'll come this, and has\n",
      "had her hand behind her ear at every noise in th' street, thinking it were him. And to-day she were\n",
      "neither to have nor to hold, but off she would go to th' post, and see if he had na sent her a line\n",
      "to th' old house near yo. I tried to get her to give up going, for let alone her deafness she's\n",
      "getten so dark, she cannot see five yards afore her; but no, she would go, poor old body.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I did not know her sight had failed her; she used to have good eyes enough when she lived near\n",
      "us.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, but it's gone lately a good deal. But you never ask after Jem—\" anxious to get in a word on\n",
      "the subject nearest her heart.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No,\" replied Mary, blushing scarlet. \"How is he?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I cannot justly say how he is, seeing he's at Halifax; but he were very well when he wrote last\n",
      "Tuesday. Han ye heard o' his good luck?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Rather to her disappointment, Mary owned she had heard of the sum his master had paid him for his\n",
      "invention.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well! and did not Margaret tell yo what he'd done wi' it? It's just like him though, ne'er to\n",
      "say a word about it. Why, when it were paid what does he do, but get his master to help him to buy\n",
      "an income for me and Alice. He had her name put down for her life; but, poor thing, she'll not be\n",
      "long to the fore, I'm thinking. She's sadly failed of late. And so, Mary, yo see, we're two ladies\n",
      "o' property. It's a matter o' twenty pound a year they tell me. I wish the twins had lived, bless\n",
      "'em,\" said she, dropping a few tears. \"They should ha' had the best o' schooling, and their\n",
      "belly-fulls o' food. I suppose they're better off in heaven, only I should so like to see 'em.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary's heart filled with love at this new proof of Jem's goodness; but she could not talk about\n",
      "it. She took Jane Wilson's hand, and pressed it with affection; and then turned the subject to Will,\n",
      "her sailor nephew. Jane was a little bit sorry, but her prosperity had made her gentler, and she did\n",
      "not resent what she felt as Mary's indifference to Jem and his merits.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He's been in Africa and that neighbourhood, I believe. He's a fine chap, but he's not gotten\n",
      "Jem's hair. His has too much o' the red in it. He sent Alice (but, maybe, she telled you) a matter\n",
      "o' five pound when he were over before; but that were nought to an income, yo know.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's not every one that can get a hundred or two at a time,\" said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! no! that's true enough. There's not many a one like Jem. That's Alice's step,\" said she,\n",
      "hastening to open the door to her sister-in-law. Alice looked weary, and sad, and dusty. The\n",
      "weariness and the dust would not have been noticed either by her, or the others, if it had not been\n",
      "for the sadness.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No letters!\" said Mrs. Wilson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, none! I must just wait another day to hear fra my lad. It's very dree work, waiting!\" said\n",
      "Alice.</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret's words came into Mary's mind. Every one has their time and kind of waiting.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If I but knew he were safe, and not drowned!\" spoke Alice. \"If I but knew he <hi>were</hi>\n",
      "drowned, I would ask grace to say, Thy will be done. It's the waiting.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's hard work to be patient to all of us,\" said Mary; \"I know I find it so, but I did not know\n",
      "one so good as you did, Alice; I shall not think so badly of myself for being a bit impatient, now\n",
      "I've heard you say you find it difficult.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The idea of reproach to Alice was the last in Mary's mind; and Alice knew it was. Nevertheless,\n",
      "she said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then, my dear, I ask your pardon, and God's pardon, too, if I've weakened your faith, by showing\n",
      "you how feeble mine was. Half our life's spent in waiting, and it ill becomes one like me, wi' so\n",
      "many mercies, to grumble. I'll try and put a bridle o'er my tongue, and my thoughts too.\" She spoke\n",
      "in a humble and gentle voice, like one asking forgiveness.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come, Alice,\" interposed Mrs. Wilson, \"don't fret yoursel for e'er a trifle wrong said here or\n",
      "there. See! I've put th' kettle on, and you and Mary shall ha' a dish o' tea in no time.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So she bustled about, and brought out a comfortable-looking substantial loaf, and set Mary to cut\n",
      "bread and butter, while she rattled out the tea-cups—always a cheerful sound.</p>\n",
      "<p>Just as they were sitting down, there was a knock heard at the door, and without waiting for it\n",
      "to be opened from the inside, some one lifted the latch, and in a man's voice asked, if one George\n",
      "Wilson lived there?</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Wilson was entering on a long and sorrowful explanation of his having once lived there, but\n",
      "of his having dropped down dead; when Alice, with the instinct of love (for in all usual and common\n",
      "instances, sight and hearing failed to convey impressions to her until long after other people had\n",
      "received them), arose, and tottered to the door.</p>\n",

      "her old withered cheeks, and dimmed the horn spectacles she had put on, in order to pry lovingly\n",
      "into his face. So what with her failing sight, and her tear-blinded eyes, she gave up the attempt of\n",
      "learning his face by heart through the medium of that sense, and tried another. She passed her\n",
      "sodden, shrivelled hands, all trembling with eagerness, over his manly face, bent meekly down in\n",

      "<p>After tea, Mary, feeling sure there was much to be said on both sides, at which it would be\n",

      "seemed to arouse Alice from her dreamy consciousness of exceeding happiness, and she hastily\n",
      "followed Mary to the door. There, standing outside, with the latch in her hand, she took hold of\n",

      "way?</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, it were Jack Harris, our third mate last voyage, as many and many a time telled us all\n",
      "about it. You see he were becalmed off Chatham Island (that's in the Great Pacific, and a warm\n",
      "enough latitude for mermaids, and sharks, and such like perils). So some of the men took the long\n",
      "boat, and pulled for the island to see what it were like; and when they got near, they heard a\n",
      "puffing, like a creature come up to take breath; you've never heard a diver? No! Well! you've heard\n",
      "folks in th' asthma, and it were for all the world like that. So they looked around, and what should\n",
      "they see but a mermaid, sitting on a rock, and sunning herself. The water is always warmer when it's\n",
      "rough, you know, so I suppose in the calm she felt it rather chilly, and had come up to warm\n",
      "herself.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What was she like?\" asked Mary, breathlessly.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job took his pipe off the chimney-piece and began to smoke with very audible puffs, as if the\n",
      "story were not worth listening to.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! Jack used to say she was for all the world as beautiful as any of the wax ladies in the\n",
      "barbers' shops; only, Mary, there were one little difference: her hair was bright grass green.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I should not think that was pretty,\" said Mary, hesitatingly; as if not liking to doubt the\n",
      "perfection of any thing belonging to such an acknowledged beauty.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! but it is when you're used to it. I always think when first we get sight of land, there's no\n",
      "colour so lovely as grass green. However, she had green hair sure enough; and were proud enough of\n",
      "it, too; for she were combing it out full-length when first they saw her. They all thought she were\n",
      "a fair prize, and may be as good as a whale in ready money (they were whale-fishers you know). For\n",
      "some folk think a deal of mermaids, whatever other folk do.\" This was a hit at Job, who retaliated\n",
      "in a series of sonorous spittings and puffs.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So, as I were saying, they pulled towards her, thinking to catch her. She were all the while\n",
      "combing her beautiful hair, and beckoning to them, while with the other hand she held a\n",
      "looking-glass.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How many hands had she?\" asked Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Two, to be sure, just like any other woman,\" answered Will, indignantly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! I thought you said she beckoned with one hand, and combed her hair with another, and held a\n",
      "looking-glass with a third,\" said Job, with provoking quietness.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! I didn't! at least if I did, I meant she did one thing after another, as any one but\" (here\n",
      "he mumbled a word or two) \"could understand. Well, Mary,\" turning very decidedly towards her, \"when\n",
      "she saw them coming near, whether it were she grew frightened at their fowling-pieces, as they had\n",
      "on board, for a bit o' shooting on the island, or whether it were she were just a fickle jade as did\n",
      "not rightly know her own mind (which, seeing one half of her was woman, I think myself was most\n",
      "probable), but when they were only about two oars' length from the rock where she sat, down she\n",
      "plopped into the water, leaving nothing but her hinder end of a fish tail sticking up for a minute,\n",
      "and then that disappeared too.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And did they never see her again?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Never so plain; the man who had the second watch one night declared he saw her swimming round\n",
      "the ship, and holding up her glass for him to look in; and then he saw the little cottage near Aber\n",
      "in Wales (where his wife lived) as plain as ever he saw it in life, and his wife standing outside,\n",
      "shading her eyes as if she were looking for him. But Jack Harris gave him no credit, for he said he\n",
      "were always a bit of a romancer, and beside that, were a home-sick, down-hearted chap.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wish they had caught her,\" said Mary, musing.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They got one thing as belonged to her,\" replied Will, \"and that I've often seen with my own\n",
      "eyes, and I reckon it's a sure proof of the truth of their story; for them that wants proof.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What was it?\" asked Margaret, almost anxious her grandfather should be convinced.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, in her hurry she left her comb on the rock, and one o' the men spied it; so they thought\n",
      "that were better than nothing, and they rowed there and took it, and Jack Harris had it on board the\n",
      "<hi>John Cropper</hi>, and I saw him comb his hair with it every Sunday morning.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What was it like?\" asked Mary, eagerly; her imagination running on coral combs, studded with\n",
      "pearls.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, if it had not had such a strange yarn belonging to it, you'd never ha' noticed it from any\n",
      "other small-tooth comb.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I should rather think not,\" sneered Job Legh.</p>\n",
      "<p>The sailor bit his lips to keep down his anger against an old man. Margaret felt very uneasy,\n",
      "knowing her grandfather so well, and not daring to guess what caustic remark might come next to\n",
      "irritate the young sailor guest.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary, however, was too much interested by the wonders of the deep to perceive the incredulity\n",
      "with which Job Legh received Wilson's account of the mermaid; and when he left off, half offended,\n",
      "and very much inclined not to open his lips again through the evening, she eagerly said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh do tell us something more of what you hear and see on board ship. Do, Will!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What's the use, Mary, if folk won't believe one. There are things I saw with my own eyes, that\n",
      "some people would pish and pshaw at, as if I were a baby to be put down by cross noises. But I'll\n",
      "tell you, Mary,\" with an emphasis on <hi>you</hi>, \"some more of the wonders of the sea, sin' you're\n",
      "not too wise to believe me. I have seen a fish fly.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>This did stagger Mary. She had heard of mermaids as signs of inns, and as sea-wonders, but never\n",
      "of flying fish. Not so Job. He put down his pipe, and nodding his head as a token of approbation, he\n",
      "said</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, ay! young man. Now you're speaking truth.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well now! you'll swallow that, old gentleman. You'll credit me when I say I've seen a crittur\n",
      "half fish, half bird, and you won't credit me when I say there be such beasts as mermaids, half\n",
      "fish, half woman. To me, one's just as strange as t'other.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You never saw the mermaid yoursel,\" interposed Margaret, gently. But \"love me, love my dog,\" was\n",
      "Will Wilson's motto, only his version was \"believe me, believe Jack Harris;\" and the remark was not\n",
      "so soothing to him as it was intended to have been.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's the Exocetus; one of the Malacopterygii Abdominales,\" said Job, much interested.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, there you go! You're one o' them folks as never knows beasts unless they're called out o'\n",
      "their names. Put 'em in Sunday clothes and you know 'em, but in their work-a-day English you never\n",
      "know nought about 'em. I've met wi' many o' your kidney; and if I'd ha' known it, I'd ha' christened\n",
      "poor Jack's mermaid wi' some grand gibberish of a name. Mermaidicus Jack Harrisensis; that's just\n",
      "like their new-fangled words. D'ye believe there's such a thing as the Mermaidicus, master?\" asked\n",
      "Will, enjoying his own joke uncommonly, as most people do.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not I! Tell me about the—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well!\" said Will, pleased at having excited the old gentleman's faith and credit at last. \"It\n",
      "were on this last voyage, about a day's sail from Madeira, that one of our men—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not Jack Harris, I hope,\" murmured Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Called me,\" continued Will, not noticing the interruption, \"to see the what d'ye call it—flying\n",
      "fish I say it is. It were twenty feet out o' water, and it flew near on to a hundred yards. But I\n",
      "say, old gentleman, I ha' gotten one dried, and if you'll take it, why, I'll give it you; only,\" he\n",

      "<p>I really believe if the assuming faith in the story of the mermaid had been made the condition of\n",
      "receiving the flying fish, Job Legh, sincere man as he was, would have pretended belief; he was so\n",
      "much delighted at the idea of possessing this specimen. He won the sailor's heart by getting up to\n",
      "shake both his hands in his vehement gratitude, puzzling poor old Alice, who yet smiled through her\n",
      "wonder; for she understood the action to indicate some kindly feeling towards her nephew.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job wanted to prove his gratitude, and was puzzled how to do it. He feared the young man would\n",
      "not appreciate any of his duplicate Araneides; not even the great American Mygale, one of his most\n",
      "precious treasures; or else he would gladly have bestowed any duplicate on the donor of a real dried\n",
      "Exocetus. What could he do for him? He could ask Margaret to sing. Other folks beside her old\n",
      "doating grandfather thought a deal of her songs. So Margaret began some of her noble old-fashioned\n",
      "songs. She knew no modern music (for which her auditors might have been thankful), but she poured\n",
      "her rich voice out in some of the old canzonets she had lately learnt while accompanying the musical\n",
      "lecturer on his tour.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary was amused to see how the young sailor sat entranced; mouth, eyes, all open, in order to\n",
      "catch every breath of sound. His very lids refused to wink, as if afraid in that brief proverbial\n",
      "interval to lose a particle of the rich music that floated through the room. For the first time the\n",
      "idea crossed Mary's mind that it was possible the plain little sensible Margaret, so prim and\n",
      "demure, might have power over the heart of the handsome, dashing, spirited Will Wilson.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job, too, was rapidly changing his opinion of his new guest. The flying fish went a great way,\n",
      "and his undisguised admiration for Margaret's singing carried him still further.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was amusing enough to see these two, within the hour so barely civil to each other,\n",
      "endeavouring now to be ultra-agreeable. Will, as soon as he had taken breath (a long, deep gasp of\n",
      "admiration) after Margaret's song, sidled up to Job, and asked him in a sort of doubting tone,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You wouldn't like a live Manx cat, would ye, master?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"A what?\" exclaimed Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't know its best name,\" said Will, humbly. \"But we call 'em just Manx cats. They're cats\n",
      "without tails.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Now Job, in all his natural history, had never heard of such animals; so Will continued,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Because I'm going, afore joining my ship, to see mother's friends in the island, and would\n",
      "gladly bring you one, if so be you'd like to have it. They look as queer and out o' nature as flying\n",
      "fish, or\"—he gulped the words down that should have followed. \"Especially when you see 'em walking a\n",
      "roof-top, right again the sky, when a cat, as is a proper cat, is sure to stick her tail stiff out\n",
      "behind, like a slack-rope dancer a-balancing; but these cats having no tail, cannot stick it out,\n",
      "which captivates some people uncommonly. If yo'll allow me, I'll bring one for Miss there,\" jerking\n",
      "his head at Margaret. Job assented with grateful curiosity, wishing much to see the tail-less\n",
      "phenomenon.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When are you going to sail?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I cannot justly say; our ship's bound for America next voyage, they tell me. A mess-mate will\n",
      "let me know when her sailing-day is fixed; but I've got to go to th' Isle o' Man first. I promised\n",
      "uncle last time I were in England to go this next time. I may have to hoist the blue Peter any day;\n",
      "so, make much of me while you have me, Mary.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job asked him if he had ever been in America.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Haven't I? North and South both! This time we're bound to North. Yankee-Land, as we call it,\n",
      "where Uncle Sam lives.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Uncle who?\" said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, it's a way sailors have of speaking. I only mean I'm going to Boston, U. S., that's Uncle\n",
      "Sam.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary did not understand, so she left him and went to sit by Alice, who could not hear\n",
      "conversation unless expressly addressed to her. She had sat patiently silent the greater part of the\n",
      "night, and now greeted Mary with a quiet smile.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where's yo'r father?\" asked she.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I guess he's at his Union; he's there most evenings.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Alice shook her head; but whether it were that she did not hear, or that she did not quite\n",
      "approve of what she heard, Mary could not make out. She sat silently watching Alice, and regretting\n",
      "over her dimmed and veiled eyes, formerly so bright and speaking; as if Alice understood by some\n",

      "thought.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yo're mourning for me, my dear; and there's no need, Mary. I'm as happy as a child. I sometimes\n",

      "missis alway telled me to speak very soft and low, and to darken the room that her little one might\n",
      "go to sleep; and now all noises are hushed and still to me, and the bonny earth seems dim and dark,\n",
      "and I know it's my Father lulling me away to my long sleep. I'm very well content, and yo mustn't\n",
      "fret for me. I've had well nigh every blessing in life I could desire.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary thought of Alice's long-cherished, fond wish to revisit the home of her childhood, so often\n",

      "<p>The spell of her name was as potent as that of the mariner's glittering eye. \"He listened like a\n",

      "<p>\"And who can yo be to know Mary Barton, or to know that she's ought to me?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a little strife in Esther's mind for an instant, between the shame of acknowledging\n",
      "herself, and the additional weight to her revelation which such acknowledgment would give. Then she\n",
      "spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Do you remember Esther, the sister of John Barton's wife? the aunt to Mary? And the Valentine I\n",

      "<p>\"Yes, I mind her well! But yo are not Esther, are you?\" He looked again into her face, and seeing\n",
      "that indeed it was his boyhood's friend, he took her hand, and shook it with a cordiality that\n",
      "forgot the present in the past.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, Esther! Where han ye been this many a year? Where han ye been wandering that we none of us\n",

      "<p>The question was asked thoughtlessly, but answered with fierce earnestness.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where have I been? What have I been doing? Why do you torment me with questions like these? Can\n",
      "you not guess? But the story of my life is wanted to give force to my speech, afterwards I will tell\n",
      "it you. Nay! don't change your fickle mind now, and say you don't want to hear it. You must hear it,\n",
      "and I must tell it; and then see after Mary, and take care she does not become like me. As she is\n",
      "loving now, so did I love once; one above me far.\" She remarked not, in her own absorption, the\n",
      "change in Jem's breathing, the sudden clutch at the wall which told the fearfully vivid interest he\n",
      "took in what she said. \"He was so handsome, so kind! Well, the regiment was ordered to Chester (did\n",
      "I tell you he was an officer?), and he could not bear to part from me, nor I from him, so he took me\n",
      "with him. I never thought poor Mary would have taken it so to heart! I always meant to send for her\n",
      "to pay me a visit when I was married; for, mark you! he promised me marriage. They all do. Then came\n",
      "three years of happiness. I suppose I ought not to have been happy, but I was. I had a little girl,\n",
      "too. Oh! the sweetest darling that ever was seen! But I must not think of her,\" putting her hand\n",
      "wildly up to her forehead, \"or I shall go mad; I shall.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't tell me any more about yoursel,\" said Jem, soothingly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What! you're tired already, are you? but I'll tell you; as you've asked for it, you shall hear\n",
      "it. I won't recall the agony of the past for nothing. I will have the relief of telling it. Oh, how\n",
      "happy I was!\"—sinking her voice into a plaintive child-like manner. \"It came like a shot on me when\n",
      "one day he came to me and told me he was ordered to Ireland, and must leave me behind; at Bristol we\n",
      "then were.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem muttered some words; she caught their meaning, and in a pleading voice continued,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, don't abuse him; don't speak a word against him! You don't know how I love him yet; yet,\n",
      "when I am sunk so low. You don't guess how kind he was. He gave me fifty pound before we parted, and\n",
      "I knew he could ill spare it. Don't, Jem, please,\" as his muttered indignation rose again. For her\n",
      "sake he ceased. \"I might have done better with the money; I see now. But I did not know the value of\n",
      "money. Formerly I had earned it easily enough at the factory, and as I had no more sensible wants, I\n",
      "spent it on dress and on eating. While I lived with him, I had it for asking; and fifty pounds\n",
      "would, I thought, go a long way. So I went back to Chester, where I'd been so happy, and set up a\n",
      "small-ware shop, and hired a room near. We should have done well, but alas! alas! my little girl\n",
      "fell ill, and I could not mind my shop and her too; and things grew worse and worse. I sold my goods\n",
      "any how to get money to buy her food and medicine; I wrote over and over again to her father for\n",
      "help, but he must have changed his quarters, for I never got an answer. The landlord seized the few\n",
      "bobbins and tapes I had left, for shop-rent; and the person to whom the mean little room, to which\n",
      "we had been forced to remove, belonged, threatened to turn us out unless his rent was paid; it had\n",
      "run on many weeks, and it was winter, cold bleak winter; and my child was so ill, so ill, and I was\n",
      "starving. And I could not bear to see her suffer, and forgot how much better it would be for us to\n",
      "die together;—oh her moans, her moans, which money would give me the means of relieving! So I went\n",
      "out into the street, one January night—Do you think God will punish me for that?\" she asked with\n",
      "wild vehemence, almost amounting to insanity, and shaking Jem's arm in order to force an answer from\n",
      "him.</p>\n",
      "<p>But before he could shape his heart's sympathy into words, her voice had lost its wildness, and\n",
      "she spoke with the quiet of despair.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But it's no matter! I've done that since, which separates us as far asunder as heaven and hell\n",
      "can be.\" Her voice rose again to the sharp pitch of agony. \"My darling! my darling! even after death\n",
      "I may not see thee, my own sweet one! She was so good—like a little angel. What is that text, I\n",
      "don't remember,—that text mother used to teach me when I sat on her knee long ago; it begins,\n",
      "'Blessed are the pure'\"—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, that's it! It would break mother's heart if she knew what I am now—it did break Mary's\n",
      "heart, you see. And now I recollect it was about her child I wanted so to see you, Jem. You know\n",
      "Mary Barton, don't you?\" said she, trying to collect her thoughts.</p>\n",
      "<p>Yes, Jem knew her. How well, his beating heart could testify!</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, there's something to do for her; I forget what; wait a minute! She is so like my little\n",
      "girl;\" said she, raising her eyes, glistening with unshed tears, in search of the sympathy of Jem's\n",
      "countenance.</p>\n",
      "<p>He deeply pitied her; but oh! how he longed to recall her mind to the subject of Mary, and the\n",
      "lover above her in rank, and the service to be done for her sake. But he controlled himself to\n",
      "silence. After awhile, she spoke again, and in a calmer voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When I came to Manchester (for I could not stay in Chester after her death), I found you all out\n",
      "very soon. And yet I never thought my poor sister was dead. I suppose I would not think so. I used\n",
      "to watch about the court where John lived, for many and many a night, and gather all I could about\n",
      "them from the neighbours' talk; for I never asked a question. I put this and that together, and\n",
      "followed one, and listened to the other; many's the time I've watched the policeman off his beat,\n",
      "and peeped through the chink of the window-shutter to see the old room, and sometimes Mary or her\n",
      "father sitting up late for some reason or another. I found out Mary went to learn dress-making, and\n",
      "I began to be frightened for her; for it's a bad life for a girl to be out late at night in the\n",
      "streets, and after many an hour of weary work, they're ready to follow after any novelty that makes\n",
      "a little change. But I made up my mind, that bad as I was, I could watch over Mary and perhaps keep\n",
      "her from harm. So I used to wait for her at nights, and follow her home, often when she little knew\n",
      "any one was near her. There was one of her companions I never could abide, and I'm sure that girl is\n",
      "at the bottom of some mischief. By-and-bye, Mary's walks homewards were not alone. She was joined\n",
      "soon after she came out, by a man; a gentleman. I began to fear for her, for I saw she was\n",
      "light-hearted, and pleased with his attentions; and I thought worse of him for having such long\n",
      "talks with that bold girl I told you of. But I was laid up for a long time with spitting of blood;\n",
      "and could do nothing. I'm sure it made me worse, thinking about what might be happening to Mary. And\n",
      "when I came out, all was going on as before, only she seemed fonder of him than ever; and oh Jem!\n",
      "her father won't listen to me, and it's you must save Mary! You're like a brother to her, and maybe\n",
      "could give her advice and watch over her, and at any rate John will hearken to you; only he's so\n",
      "stern and so cruel.\" She began to cry a little at the remembrance of his harsh words; but Jem cut\n",
      "her short by his hoarse, stern inquiry,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Who is this spark that Mary loves? Tell me his name!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's young Carson, old Carson's son, that your father worked for.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a pause. She broke the silence.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! Jem, I charge you with the care of her! I suppose it would be murder to kill her, but it\n",
      "would be better for her to die than to live to lead such a life as I do. Do you hear me, Jem?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes! I hear you. It would be better. Better we were all dead.\" This was said as if thinking\n",
      "aloud; but he immediately changed his tone, and continued,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Esther, you may trust to my doing all I can for Mary. That I have determined on. And now listen\n",
      "to me! you loathe the life you lead, else you would not speak of it as you do. Come home with me.\n",
      "Come to my mother. She and my aunt Alice live together. I will see that they give you a welcome. And\n",
      "to-morrow I will see if some honest way of living cannot be found for you. Come home with me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She was silent for a minute, and he hoped he had gained his point. Then she said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"God bless you, Jem, for the words you have just spoken. Some years ago you might have saved me,\n",
      "as I hope and trust you will yet save Mary. But it is too late now;—too late,\" she added, with\n",
      "accents of deep despair.</p>\n",
      "<p>Still he did not relax his hold. \"Come home,\" he said.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I tell you, I cannot. I could not lead a virtuous life if I would. I should only disgrace you.\n",
      "If you will know all,\" said she, as he still seemed inclined to urge her, \"I must have drink. Such\n",
      "as live like me could not bear life if they did not drink. It's the only thing to keep us from\n",
      "suicide. If we did not drink, we could not stand the memory of what we have been, and the thought of\n",
      "what we are, for a day. If I go without food, and without shelter, I must have my dram. Oh! you\n",
      "don't know the awful nights I have had in prison for want of it!\" said she, shuddering, and glaring\n",
      "round with terrified eyes, as if dreading to see some spiritual creature, with dim form, near\n",
      "her.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It is so frightful to see them,\" whispering in tones of wildness, although so low spoken. \"There\n",
      "they go round and round my bed the whole night through. My mother, carrying little Annie (I wonder\n",
      "how they got together) and Mary—and all looking at me with their sad, stony eyes; oh Jem! it is so\n",
      "terrible! They don't turn back either, but pass behind the head of the bed, and I feel their eyes on\n",
      "me everywhere. If I creep under the clothes I still see them; and what is worse,\" hissing out her\n",
      "words with fright, \"they see me. Don't speak to me of leading a better life—I must have drink. I\n",
      "cannot pass to-night without a dram; I dare not.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem was silent from deep sympathy. Oh! could he, then, do nothing for her! She spoke again, but\n",
      "in a less excited tone, although it was thrillingly earnest.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You are grieved for me! I know it better than if you told me in words. But you can do nothing\n",
      "for me. I am past hope. You can yet save Mary. You must. She is innocent, except for the great error\n",
      "of loving one above her in station. Jem! you <hi>will</hi> save her?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>With heart and soul, though in few words, Jem promised that if aught earthly could keep her from\n",
      "falling, he would do it. Then she blessed him, and bade him good-night.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Stay a minute,\" said he, as she was on the point of departure. \"I may want to speak to you\n",
      "again. I mun know where to find you—where do you live?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She laughed strangely. \"And do you think one sunk so low as I am has a home? Decent, good people\n",
      "have homes. We have none. No, if you want me, come at night, and look at the corners of the streets\n",
      "about here. The colder, the bleaker, the more stormy the night, the more certain you will be to find\n",
      "me. For then,\" she added, with a plaintive fall in her voice, \"it is so cold sleeping in entries,\n",
      "and on door-steps, and I want a dram more than ever.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Again she rapidly turned off, and Jem also went on his way. But before he reached the end of the\n",
      "street, even in the midst of the jealous anguish that filled his heart, his conscience smote him. He\n",
      "had not done enough to save her. One more effort, and she might have come. Nay, twenty efforts would\n",
      "have been well rewarded by her yielding. He turned back, but she was gone. In the tumult of his\n",
      "other feelings, his self-reproach was deadened for the time. But many and many a day afterwards he\n",
      "bitterly regretted his omission of duty; his weariness of well-doing.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, the great thing was to reach home, and solitude. Mary loved another! Oh! how should he bear\n",
      "it? He had thought her rejection of him a hard trial, but that was nothing now. He only remembered\n",
      "it, to be thankful he had not yielded to the temptation of trying his fate again, not in actual\n",
      "words, but in a meeting, where her manner should tell far more than words, that her sweeter smiles,\n",
      "her dainty movements, her pretty household ways, were all to be reserved to gladden another's eyes\n",
      "and heart. And he must live on; that seemed the strangest. That a long life (and he knew men did\n",
      "live long, even with deep, biting sorrow corroding at their hearts) must be spent without Mary; nay,\n",
      "with the consciousness she was another's! That hell of thought he would reserve for the quiet of his\n",
      "own room, the dead stillness of night. He was on the threshold of home now.</p>\n",
      "<p>He entered. There were the usual faces, the usual sights. He loathed them, and then he cursed\n",
      "himself because he loathed them. His mother's love had taken a cross turn, because he had kept the\n",
      "tempting supper she had prepared for him waiting until it was nearly spoilt. Alice, her dulled\n",
      "senses deadening day by day, sat mutely near the fire; her happiness, bounded by the circle of the\n",
      "consciousness of the presence of her foster child, knowing that his voice repeated what was passing\n",
      "to her deafened ear, that his arm removed each little obstacle to her tottering steps. And Will, out\n",
      "of the very kindness of his heart, talked more and more merrily than ever. He saw Jem was downcast,\n",
      "and fancied his rattling might cheer him; at any rate, it drowned his aunt's muttered grumblings,\n",
      "and in some measure concealed the blank of the evening. At last, bed-time came; and Will withdrew to\n",
      "his neighbouring lodging; and Jane and Alice Wilson had raked the fire, and fastened doors and\n",
      "shutters, and pattered up stairs, with their tottering foot-steps, and shrill voices. Jem, too, went\n",
      "to the closet termed his bed-room. There was no bolt to the door; but by one strong effort of his\n",
      "right arm, a heavy chest was moved against it, and he could sit down on the side of his bed, and\n",
      "think.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary loved another! That idea would rise uppermost in his mind, and had to be combated in all its\n",
      "forms of pain. It was, perhaps, no great wonder that she should prefer one so much above Jem in the\n",
      "external things of life. But the gentleman; why did he, with his range of choice among the ladies of\n",
      "the land, why did he stoop down to carry off the poor man's darling? With all the glories of the\n",
      "garden at his hand, why did he prefer to cull the wild-rose,—Jem's own fragrant wild-rose?</p>\n",
      "<p>His <hi>own!</hi> Oh! never now his own!—Gone for evermore!</p>\n",
      "<p>Then uprose the guilty longing for blood!—The frenzy of jealousy!—Some one should die. He would\n",
      "rather Mary were dead, cold in her grave, than that she were another's. A vision of her pale, sweet\n",
      "face, with her bright hair all bedabbled with gore, seemed to float constantly before his aching\n",
      "eyes. But hers were ever open, and contained, in their soft, deathly look, such mute reproach! What\n",
      "had she done to deserve such cruel treatment from him? She had been wooed by one whom Jem knew to be\n",
      "handsome, gay, and bright, and she had given him her love. That was all! It was the wooer who should\n",
      "die. Yes, die, knowing the cause of his death. Jem pictured him (and gloated on the picture), lying\n",
      "smitten, yet conscious; and listening to the upbraiding accusation of his murderer. How he had left\n",
      "his own rank, and dared to love a maiden of low degree; and—oh! stinging agony of all—how she, in\n",
      "return, had loved him! Then the other nature spoke up, and bade him remember the anguish he should\n",
      "so prepare for Mary! At first he refused to listen to that better voice; or listened only to\n",
      "pervert. He would glory in her wailing grief! he would take pleasure in her desolation of heart!</p>\n",
      "<p>No! he could not, said the still small voice. It would be worse, far worse, to have caused such\n",
      "woe, than it was now to bear his present heavy burden.</p>\n",
      "<p>But it was too heavy, too grievous to be borne, and live. He would slay himself, and the lovers\n",
      "should love on, and the sun shine bright, and he with his burning, woeful heart would be at rest.\n",
      "\"Rest that is reserved for the people of God.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Had he not promised with such earnest purpose of soul, as makes words more solemn than oaths, to\n",
      "save Mary from becoming such as Esther? Should he shrink from the duties of life, into the\n",
      "cowardliness of death? Who would then guard Mary, with her love and her innocence? Would it not be a\n",
      "goodly thing to serve her, although she loved him not; to be her preserving angel, through the\n",
      "perils of life; and she, unconscious all the while?</p>\n",
      "<p>He braced up his soul, and said to himself, that with God's help he would be that earthly\n",
      "keeper.</p>\n",
      "<p>And now the mists and the storms seemed clearing away from his path, though it still was full of\n",
      "stinging thorns. Having done the duty nearest to him (of reducing the tumult of his own heart to\n",
      "something like order), the second became more plain before him.</p>\n",
      "<p>Poor Esther's experience had led her, perhaps, too hastily to the conclusion, that Mr. Carson's\n",
      "intentions were evil towards Mary; at least she had given no just ground for the fears she\n",
      "entertained that such was the case. It was possible, nay, to Jem's heart, very probable, that he\n",
      "might only be too happy to marry her. She was a lady by right of nature, Jem thought; in movement,\n",
      "grace, and spirit. what was birth to a Manchester manufacturer, many of whom glory, and justly too,\n",
      "in being the architects of their own fortunes? And, as far as wealth was concerned, judging another\n",
      "by himself, Jem could only imagine it a great privilege to lay it at the feet of the loved one.\n",
      "Harry Carson's mother had been a factory girl; so, after all, what was the great reason for doubting\n",
      "his intentions towards Mary?</p>\n",
      "<p>There might probably be some little awkwardness about the affair at first: Mary's father having\n",
      "such strong prejudices on the one hand; and something of the same kind being likely to exist on the\n",
      "part of Mr. Carson's family. But Jem knew he had power over John Barton's mind; and it would be\n",
      "something to exert that power in promoting Mary's happiness, and to relinquish all thought of self\n",
      "in so doing.</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh! why had Esther chosen him for this office? It was beyond his strength to act rightly! Why had\n",
      "she singled him out?</p>\n",
      "<p>The answer came when he was calm enough to listen for it. Because Mary had no other friend\n",
      "capable of the duty required of him; the duty of a brother, as Esther imagined him to be in feeling,\n",
      "from his long friendship. He would be unto her as a brother.</p>\n",
      "<p>As such, he ought to ascertain Harry Carson's intentions towards her in winning her affections.\n",
      "He would ask him, straightforwardly, as became man speaking to man, not concealing, if need were,\n",
      "the interest he felt in Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then, with the resolve to do his duty to the best of his power, peace came into his soul; he had\n",

      "The deep mortification he then experienced (with, perhaps, as little selfishness for its cause as\n",
      "mortification ever had) was of no temporary nature; indeed, few of his feelings were.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then came a long period of bodily privation; of daily hunger after food; and though he tried to\n",
      "persuade himself he could bear want himself with stoical indifference, and did care about it as\n",
      "little as most men, yet the body took its revenge for its uneasy feelings. The mind became soured\n",
      "and morose, and lost much of its equipoise. It was no longer elastic, as in the days of youth, or in\n",
      "times of comparative happiness; it ceased to hope. And it is hard to live on when one can no longer\n",
      "hope.</p>\n",
      "<p>The same state of feeling which John Barton entertained, if belonging to one who had had leisure\n",
      "to think of such things, and physicians to give names to them, would have been called monomania; so\n",
      "haunting, so incessant, were the thoughts that pressed upon him. I have somewhere read a forcibly\n",
      "described punishment among the Italians, worthy of a Borgia. The supposed or real criminal was shut\n",
      "up in a room, supplied with every convenience and luxury; and at first mourned little over his\n",
      "imprisonment. But day by day he became aware that the space between the walls of his apartment was\n",
      "narrowing, and then he understood the end. Those painted walls would come into hideous nearness, and\n",
      "at last crush the life out of him.</p>\n",
      "<p>And so day by day, nearer and nearer, came the diseased thoughts of John Barton. They excluded\n",
      "the light of heaven, the cheering sounds of earth. They were preparing his death.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is true, much of their morbid power might be ascribed to the use of opium. But before you\n",
      "blame too harshly this use, or rather abuse, try a hopeless life, with daily cravings of the body\n",
      "for food. Try, not alone being without hope yourself, but seeing all around you reduced to the same\n",

      "language), by their looks and feeble actions, that they are suffering and sinking under the pressure\n",
      "of want. Would you not be glad to forget life, and its burdens? And opium gives forgetfulness for a\n",
      "time.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is true they who thus purchase it pay dearly for their oblivion; but can you expect the\n",
      "uneducated to count the cost of their whistle? Poor wretches! They pay a heavy price. Days of\n",
      "oppressive weariness and languor, whose realities have the feeble sickliness of dreams; nights,\n",
      "whose dreams are fierce realities of agony; sinking health, tottering frames, incipient madness, and\n",
      "worse, the <hi>consciousness</hi> of incipient madness; this is the price of their whistle. But have\n",
      "you taught them the science of consequences?</p>\n",
      "<p>John Barton's overpowering thought, which was to work out his fate on earth, was rich and poor;\n",
      "why are they so separate, so distinct, when God has made them all? It is not His will, that their\n",
      "interests are so far apart. Whose doing is it?</p>\n",
      "<p>And so on into the problems and mysteries of life, until, bewildered and lost, unhappy and\n",
      "suffering, the only feeling that remained clear and undisturbed in the tumult of his heart, was\n",
      "hatred to the one class and keen sympathy with the other.</p>\n",
      "<p>But what availed his sympathy? No education had given him wisdom; and without wisdom, even love,\n",
      "with all its effects, too often works but harm. He acted to the best of his judgment, but it was a\n",
      "widely-erring judgment.</p>\n",
      "<p>The actions of the uneducated seem to me typified in those of Frankenstein, that monster of many\n",

      "have we made them what they are; a powerful monster, yet without the inner means for peace and\n",
      "happiness?</p>\n",
      "<p>John Barton became a Chartist, a Communist, all that is commonly called wild and visionary. Ay!\n",
      "but being visionary is something. It shows a soul, a being not altogether sensual; a creature who\n",
      "looks forward for others, if not for himself.</p>\n",
      "<p>And with all his weakness he had a sort of practical power, which made him useful to the bodies\n",
      "of men to whom he belonged. He had a ready kind of rough Lancashire eloquence, arising out of the\n",
      "fulness of his heart, which was very stirring to men similarly circumstanced, who liked to hear\n",
      "their feelings put into words. He had a pretty clear head at times, for method and arrangement; a\n",
      "necessary talent to large combinations of men. And what perhaps more than all made him relied upon\n",
      "and valued, was the consciousness which every one who came in contact with him felt, that he was\n",
      "actuated by no selfish motives; that his class, his order, was what he stood by, not the rights of\n",
      "his own paltry self. For even in great and noble men, as soon as self comes into prominent\n",
      "existence, it becomes a mean and paltry thing.</p>\n",
      "<p>A little time before this, there had come one of those occasions for deliberation among the\n",
      "employed, which deeply interested John Barton; and the discussions concerning which had caused his\n",
      "frequent absence from home of late.</p>\n",
      "<p>I am not sure if I can express myself in the technical terms of either masters or workmen, but I\n",
      "will try simply to state the case on which the latter deliberated.</p>\n",
      "<p>An order for coarse goods came in from a new foreign market. It was a large order, giving\n",
      "employment to all the mills engaged in that species of manufacture: but it was necessary to execute\n",
      "it speedily, and at as low prices as possible, as the masters had reason to believe a duplicate\n",
      "order had been sent to one of the continental manufacturing towns, where there were no restrictions\n",
      "on food, no taxes on building or machinery, and where consequently they dreaded that the goods could\n",
      "be made at a much lower price than they could afford them for; and that, by so acting and charging,\n",
      "the rival manufacturers would obtain undivided possession of the market. It was clearly their\n",
      "interest to buy cotton as cheaply, and to beat down wages as low as possible. And in the long run\n",
      "the interests of the workmen would have been thereby benefited. Distrust each other as they may, the\n",
      "employers and the employed must rise or fall together. There may be some difference as to\n",
      "chronology, none as to fact.</p>\n",
      "<p>But the masters did not choose to make all these facts known. They stood upon being the masters,\n",
      "and that they had a right to order work at their own prices, and they believed that in the present\n",
      "depression of trade, and unemployment of hands, there would be no great difficulty in getting it\n",
      "done.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now let us turn to the workmen's view of the question. The masters (of the tottering foundation\n",
      "of whose prosperity they were ignorant) seemed doing well, and like gentlemen, \"lived at home in\n",
      "ease,\" while they were starving, gasping on from day to day; and there was a foreign order to be\n",
      "executed, the extent of which, large as it was, was greatly exaggerated; and it was to be done\n",
      "speedily. Why were the masters offering such low wages under these circumstances? Shame upon them!\n",
      "It was taking advantage of their work-people being almost starved; but they would starve entirely\n",
      "rather than come into such terms. It was bad enough to be poor, while by the labour of their thin\n",
      "hands, the sweat of their brows, the masters were made rich; but they would not be utterly ground\n",
      "down to dust. No! they would fold their hands, and sit idle, and smile at the masters, whom even in\n",
      "death they could baffle. With Spartan endurance they determined to let the employers know their\n",
      "power, by refusing to work.</p>\n",
      "<p>So class distrusted class, and their want of mutual confidence wrought sorrow to both. The\n",
      "masters would not be bullied, and compelled to reveal why they felt it wisest and best to offer only\n",
      "such low wages; they would not be made to tell that they were even sacrificing capital to obtain a\n",
      "decisive victory over the continental manufacturers. And the workmen sat silent and stern with\n",
      "folded hands, refusing to work for such pay. There was a strike in Manchester.</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course it was succeeded by the usual consequences. Many other Trades' Unions, connected with\n",
      "different branches of business, supported with money, countenance, and encouragement of every kind,\n",
      "the stand which the Manchester power-loom weavers were making against their masters. Delegates from\n",
      "Glasgow, from Nottingham, and other towns, were sent to Manchester, to keep up the spirit of\n",
      "resistance; a committee was formed, and all the requisite officers elected; chairman, treasurer,\n",
      "honorary secretary:—among them was John Barton.</p>\n",
      "<p>The masters, meanwhile, took their measures. They placarded the walls with advertisements for\n",
      "power-loom weavers. The workmen replied by a placard in still larger letters, stating their\n",
      "grievances. The masters met daily in town, to mourn over the time (so fast slipping away) for the\n",
      "fulfilment of the foreign orders; and to strengthen each other in their resolution not to yield. If\n",
      "they gave up now, they might give up always. It would never do. And amongst the most energetic of\n",
      "the masters, the Carsons, father and son, took their places. It is well known, that there is no\n",
      "religionist so zealous as a convert; no masters so stern, and regardless of the interests of their\n",
      "work-people, as those who have risen from such a station themselves. This would account for the\n",
      "elder Mr. Carson's determination not to be bullied into yielding; not even to be bullied into giving\n",
      "reasons for acting as the masters did. It was the employer's will, and that should be enough for the\n",
      "employed. Harry Carson did not trouble himself much about the grounds for his conduct. He liked the\n",
      "excitement of the affair. He liked the attitude of resistance. He was brave, and he liked the idea\n",
      "of personal danger, with which some of the more cautious tried to intimidate the violent among the\n",
      "masters.</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, the power-loom weavers living in the more remote parts of Lancashire, and the\n",
      "neighbouring counties, heard of the masters' advertisements for workmen; and in their solitary\n",
      "dwellings grew weary of starvation, and resolved to come to Manchester. Foot-sore, way-worn,\n",
      "half-starved looking men they were, as they tried to steal into town in the early dawn, before\n",
      "people were astir, or late in the dusk of evening. And now began the real wrong-doing of the Trades'\n",
      "Unions. As to their decision to work, or not, at such a particular rate of wages, that was either\n",
      "wise or unwise; all error of judgment at the worst. But they had no right to tyrannise over others,\n",
      "and tie them down to their own procrustean bed. Abhorring what they considered oppression in the\n",
      "masters, why did they oppress others? Because, when men get excited, they know not what they do.\n",
      "Judge, then, with something of the mercy of the Holy One, whom we all love.</p>\n",
      "<p>In spite of policemen set to watch over the safety of the poor country weavers,—in spite of\n",
      "magistrates, and prisons, and severe punishments,—the poor depressed men tramping in from Burnley,\n",
      "Padiham, and other places, to work at the condemned \"Starvation Prices,\" were waylaid, and beaten,\n",
      "and left almost for dead by the road-side. The police broke up every lounging knot of men:—they\n",
      "separated quietly, to reunite half-a-mile further out of town.</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course the feeling between the masters and workmen did not improve under these\n",
      "circumstances.</p>\n",
      "<p>Combination is an awful power. It is like the equally mighty agency of steam; capable of almost\n",
      "unlimited good or evil. But to obtain a blessing on its labours, it must work under the direction of\n",
      "a high and intelligent will; incapable of being misled by passion, or excitement. The will of the\n",
      "operatives had not been guided to the calmness of wisdom.</p>\n",
      "<p>So much for generalities. Let us now return to individuals.</p>\n",
      "<p>A note, respectfully worded, although its tone of determination was strong, had been sent from\n",
      "the power-loom weavers, requesting that a \"deputation\" of them might have a meeting with the\n",
      "masters, to state the conditions they must have fulfilled before they would end the turn-out. They\n",
      "thought they had attained a sufficiently commanding position to dictate. John Barton was appointed\n",
      "one of the deputation.</p>\n",
      "<p>The masters agreed to this meeting, being anxious to end the strife, although undetermined among\n",
      "themselves how far they should yield, or whether they should yield at all. Some of the old, whose\n",
      "experience had taught them sympathy, were for concession. Others, white-headed men too, had only\n",
      "learnt hardness and obstinacy from the days of the years of their lives, and sneered at the more\n",
      "gentle and yielding. The younger men were one and all for an unflinching resistance to claims urged\n",
      "with so much violence. Of this party Harry Carson was the leader.</p>\n",
      "<p>But like all energetic people, the more he had to do the more time he seemed to find. With all\n",
      "his letter-writing, his calling, his being present at the New Bailey, when investigations of any\n",
      "case of violence against knob-sticks <ref target=\"#footnote44\">[44]</ref> were going on, he beset\n",
      "Mary more than ever. She was weary of her life for him. From blandishments he had even gone to\n",
      "threats—threats that whether she would or not she should be his; he showed an indifference that was\n",
      "almost insulting to every thing that might attract attention and injure her character.</p>\n",
      "<p>And still she never saw Jem. She knew he had returned home. She heard of him occasionally through\n",
      "his cousin, who roved gaily from house to house, finding and making friends everywhere. But she\n",
      "never saw him. What was she to think? Had he given her up? Were a few hasty words, spoken in a\n",
      "moment of irritation, to stamp her lot through life? At times she thought that she could bear this\n",
      "meekly, happy in her own constant power of loving. For of change or of forgetfulness she did not\n",
      "dream. Then at other times her state of impatience was such, that it required all her self-restraint\n",
      "to prevent her from going and seeking him out, and (as man would do to man, or woman to woman)\n",
      "begging him to forgive her hasty words, and allow her to retract them, and bidding him accept of the\n",
      "love that was filling her whole heart. She wished Margaret had not advised her against such a manner\n",
      "of proceeding; she believed it was her friend's words that seemed to make such a simple action\n",
      "impossible, in spite of all the internal urgings. But a friend's advice is only thus powerful, when\n",
      "it puts into language the secret oracle of our souls. It was the whisperings of her womanly nature\n",
      "that caused her to shrink from any unmaidenly action, not Margaret's counsel.</p>\n",
      "<p>All this time, this ten days or so, of Will's visit to Manchester, there was something going on\n",
      "which interested Mary even now, and which, in former times, would have exceedingly amused and\n",
      "excited her. She saw as clearly as if told in words, that the merry, random, boisterous sailor had\n",
      "fallen deeply in love with the quiet, prim, somewhat plain Margaret: she doubted if Margaret was\n",
      "aware of it, and yet, as she watched more closely, she began to think some instinct made the blind\n",
      "girl feel whose eyes were so often fixed upon her pale face; that some inner feeling made the\n",
      "delicate and becoming rose-flush steal over her countenance. She did not speak so decidedly as\n",
      "before; there was a hesitation in her manner, that seemed to make her very attractive; as if\n",
      "something softer, more loveable than excellent sense, were coming in as a motive for speech; her\n",
      "eyes had always been soft, and were in no ways disfigured by her blindness, and now seemed to have a\n",
      "new charm, as they quivered under their white down-cast lids. She must be conscious, thought\n",
      "Mary,—heart answering heart.</p>\n",
      "<p>Will's love had no blushings, no downcast eyes, no weighing of words; it was as open and\n",
      "undisguised as his nature; yet he seemed afraid of the answer its acknowledgment might meet with. It\n",
      "was Margaret's angelic voice that had entranced him, and which made him think of her as a being of\n",
      "some other sphere, that he feared to woo. So he tried to propitiate Job in all manner of ways. He\n",
      "went over to Liverpool to rummage in his great sea-chest for the flying-fish (no very odorous\n",
      "present by the way). He hesitated over a child's caul for some time, which was, in his eyes, a far\n",
      "greater treasure than any Exocetus. What use could it be of to a landsman? Then Margaret's voice\n",
      "rang in his ears; and he determined to sacrifice it, his most precious possession, to one whom she\n",

      "<p>It was rather a relief to him, when, having put it and the flying-fish together in a brown paper\n",
      "parcel, and sat upon them for security all the way in the railroad, he found that Job was so\n",
      "indifferent to the precious caul, that he might easily claim it again. He hung about Margaret, till\n",
      "he had received many warnings and reproaches from his conscience in behalf of his dear aunt Alice's\n",
      "claims upon his time. He went away, and then he bethought him of some other little word with Job.\n",
      "And he turned back, and stood talking once more in Margaret's presence, door in hand, only waiting\n",
      "for some little speech of encouragement to come in and sit down again. But as the invitation was not\n",
      "given, he was forced to leave at last, and go and do his duty.</p>\n",
      "<p>Four days had Jem Wilson watched for Mr. Harry Carson without success; his hours of going and\n",
      "returning to his home were so irregular, owing to the meetings and consultations among the masters,\n",
      "which were rendered necessary by the turn-out. On the fifth, without any purpose on Jem's part, they\n",
      "met.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was the workmen's dinner-hour, the interval between twelve and one; when the streets of\n",
      "Manchester are comparatively quiet, for a few shopping ladies and lounging gentlemen count for\n",
      "nothing in that busy, bustling, living place. Jem had been on an errand for his master, instead of\n",
      "returning to his dinner; and in passing along a lane, a road (called, in compliment to the\n",
      "intentions of some future builder, a street), he encountered Harry Carson, the only person, as far\n",
      "as he saw beside himself, treading the unfrequented path. Along one side ran a high broad fence,\n",
      "blackened over by coal-tar, and spiked and stuck with pointed nails at the top, to prevent any one\n",
      "from climbing over into the garden beyond. By this fence was the foot-path. The carriage road was\n",
      "such as no carriage, no, not even a cart, could possibly have passed along, without Hercules to\n",
      "assist in lifting it out of the deep clay ruts. On the other side of the way was a dead brick wall;\n",
      "and a field after that, where there was a sawpit, and joiner's shed.</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem's heart beat violently when he saw the gay, handsome young man approaching, with a light,\n",
      "buoyant step. This, then, was he whom Mary loved. It was, perhaps, no wonder; for he seemed to the\n",
      "poor smith so elegant, so well-appointed, that he felt his superiority in externals, strangely and\n",
      "painfully, for an instant. Then something uprose within him, and told him, that \"a man's a man for\n",
      "a' that, for a' that, and twice as much as a' that.\" And he no longer felt troubled by the outward\n",
      "appearance of his rival.</p>\n",
      "<p>Harry Carson came on, lightly bounding over the dirty places with almost a lad's buoyancy. To his\n",
      "surprise the dark, sturdy-looking artisan stopped him by saying respectfully,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"May I speak a word wi' you, sir?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Certainly, my good man,\" looking his astonishment; then finding that the promised speech did not\n",
      "come very quickly, he added, \"But make haste, for I'm in a hurry.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem had cast about for some less abrupt way of broaching the subject uppermost in his mind than\n",
      "he now found himself obliged to use. With a husky voice that trembled as he spoke, he said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I think, sir, yo're keeping company wi' a young woman called Mary Barton?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>A light broke in upon Harry Carson's mind, and he paused before he gave the answer for which the\n",
      "other waited.</p>\n",
      "<p>Could this man be a lover of Mary's? And (strange, stinging thought) could he be beloved by her,\n",
      "and so have caused her obstinate rejection of himself? He looked at Jem from head to foot, a black,\n",
      "grimy mechanic, in dirty fustian clothes, strongly built, and awkward (according to the\n",
      "dancing-master); then he glanced at himself, and recalled the reflection he had so lately quitted in\n",
      "his bed-room. It was impossible. No woman with eyes could choose the one when the other wooed. It\n",
      "was Hyperion to a Satyr. That quotation came aptly; he forgot \"That a man's a man for a' that.\" And\n",
      "yet here was a clue, which he had often wanted, to her changed conduct towards him. If she loved\n",
      "this man. If— he hated the fellow, and longed to strike him. He would know all.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary Barton! let me see. Ay, that is the name of the girl. An arrant flirt, the little hussy is;\n",
      "but very pretty. Ay, Mary Barton is her name.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem bit his lips. Was it then so; that Mary was a flirt, the giddy creature of whom he spoke? He\n",
      "would not believe it, and yet how he wished the suggestive words unspoken. That thought must keep\n",
      "now, though. Even if she were, the more reason for there being some one to protect her; poor, faulty\n",
      "darling.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She's a good girl, sir, though may be a bit set up with her beauty; but she's her father's only\n",
      "child, sir, and—\" he stopped; he did not like to express suspicion, and yet he was determined he\n",
      "would be certain there was ground for none. What should he say?</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, my fine fellow, and what have I to do with that? It's but loss of my time, and yours, too,\n",
      "if you've only stopped me to tell me Mary Barton is very pretty; I know that well enough.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He seemed as though he would have gone on, but Jem put his black, working, right hand upon his\n",
      "arm to detain him. The haughty young man shook it off, and with his glove pretended to brush away\n",
      "the sooty contamination that might be left upon his light great-coat sleeve. The little action\n",
      "aroused Jem.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I will tell you in plain words what I have got to say to you, young man. It's been telled me by\n",
      "one as knows, and has seen, that you walk with this same Mary Barton, and are known to be courting\n",
      "her; and her as spoke to me about it, thinks as how Mary loves you. That may be, or may not. But I'm\n",
      "an old friend of hers, and her father's; and I just wished to know if you mean to marry the girl.\n",
      "Spite of what you said of her lightness, I ha' known her long enough to be sure she'll make a noble\n",
      "wife for any one, let him be what he may; and I mean to stand by her like a brother; and if you mean\n",
      "rightly, you'll not think the worse on me for what I've now said; and if—but no, I'll not say what\n",
      "I'll do to the man who wrongs a hair of her head. He shall rue it the longest day he lives, that's\n",
      "all. Now, sir, what I ask of you is this. If you mean fair and honourable by her, well and good; but\n",
      "if not, for your own sake as well as hers, leave her alone, and never speak to her more.\" Jem's\n",
      "voice quivered with the earnestness with which he spoke, and he eagerly waited for some answer.</p>\n",
      "<p>Harry Carson, meanwhile, instead of attending very particularly to the purpose the man had in\n",
      "addressing him, was trying to gather from his speech what was the real state of the case. He\n",
      "succeeded so far as to comprehend that Jem inclined to believe that Mary loved his rival; and\n",
      "consequently, that if the speaker were attached to her himself, he was not a favoured admirer. The\n",
      "idea came into Mr. Carson's mind, that perhaps, after all, Mary loved him in spite of her frequent\n",
      "and obstinate rejections; and that she had employed this person (whoever he was) to bully him into\n",
      "marrying her. He resolved to try and ascertain more correctly the man's relation to her. Either he\n",
      "was a lover, and if so, not a favoured one (in which case Mr. Carson could not at all understand the\n",
      "man's motives for interesting himself in securing her marriage); or he was a friend, an accomplice,\n",
      "whom she had employed to bully him. So little faith in goodness have the mean and selfish!</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Before I make you into my confidant, my good man,\" said Mr. Carson, in a contemptuous tone, \"I\n",
      "think it might be as well to inquire your right to meddle with our affairs. Neither Mary nor I, as I\n",
      "conceive, called you in as a mediator.\" He paused; he wanted a distinct answer to this last\n",
      "supposition. None came; so he began to imagine he was to be threatened into some engagement, and his\n",
      "angry spirit rose.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And so, my fine fellow, you will have the kindness to leave us to ourselves, and not meddle with\n",
      "what does not concern you. If you were a brother, or father of hers, the case might have been\n",
      "different. As it is, I can only consider you an impertinent meddler.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Again he would have passed on, but Jem stood in a determined way before him, saying,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You say if I had been her brother, or her father, you'd have answered me what I ask. Now,\n",
      "neither father nor brother could love her as I have loved her, ay, and as I love her still; if love\n",
      "gives a right to satisfaction, it's next to impossible any one breathing can come up to my right.\n",
      "Now, sir, tell me! do you mean fair by Mary or not? I've proved my claim to know, and, by G——, I\n",
      "will know.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come, come, no impudence,\" replied Mr. Carson, who, having discovered what he wanted to know\n",
      "(namely, that Jem was a lover of Mary's, and that she was not encouraging his suit), wished to pass\n",
      "on.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Father, brother, or rejected lover\" (with an emphasis on the word rejected), \"no one has a right\n",
      "to interfere between my little girl and me. No one shall. Confound you, man! get out of my way, or\n",
      "I'll make you,\" as Jem still obstructed his path with dogged determination.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I won't, then, till you've given me your word about Mary,\" replied the mechanic, grinding his\n",
      "words out between his teeth, and the livid paleness of the anger he could no longer keep down\n",
      "covering his face till he looked ghastly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Won't you?\" (with a taunting laugh), \"then I'll make you.\" The young man raised his slight cane,\n",
      "and smote the artisan across the face with a stinging stroke. An instant afterwards he lay stretched\n",
      "in the muddy road, Jem standing over him, panting with rage. What he would have done next in his\n",
      "moment of ungovernable passion, no one knows; but a policeman from the main street, into which this\n",
      "road led, had been sauntering about for some time, unobserved by either of the parties, and\n",
      "expecting some kind of conclusion like the present to the violent discussion going on between the\n",
      "two young men. In a minute he had pinioned Jem, who sullenly yielded to the surprise.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson was on his feet directly, his face glowing with rage or shame.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Shall I take him to the lock-ups for assault, sir?\" said the policeman.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, no,\" exclaimed Mr. Carson; \"I struck him first. It was no assault on his side; though,\" he\n",
      "continued, hissing out his words to Jem, who even hated freedom procured for him, however justly, at\n",
      "the intervention of his rival, \"I will never forgive or forget your insult. Trust me,\" he gasped the\n",
      "words in excess of passion, \"Mary shall fare no better for your insolent interference.\" He laughed,\n",
      "as if with the consciousness of power.</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem replied with equal excitement—\"And if you dare to injure her in the least, I will await you\n",
      "where no policeman can step in between. And God shall judge between us two.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The policeman now interfered with persuasions and warnings. He locked his arm in Jem's to lead\n",
      "him away in an opposite direction to that in which he saw Mr. Carson was going. Jem submitted\n",
      "gloomily, for a few steps, then wrenched himself free. The policeman shouted after him,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Take care, my man! there's no girl on earth worth what you'll be bringing on yourself if you\n",
      "don't mind.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>The day arrived on which the masters were to have an interview with a deputation of the\n",
      "work-people. The meeting was to take place in a public room, at an hotel; and there, about eleven\n",
      "o'clock, the mill-owners, who had received the foreign orders, began to collect.</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course, the first subject, however full their minds might be of another, was the weather.\n",
      "Having done their duty by all the showers and sunshine which had occurred during the past week, they\n",
      "fell to talking about the business which brought them together. There might be about twenty\n",
      "gentlemen in the room, including some by courtesy, who were not immediately concerned in the\n",
      "settlement of the present question; but who, nevertheless, were sufficiently interested to attend.\n",
      "These were divided into little groups, who did not seem unanimous by any means. Some were for a\n",
      "slight concession, just a sugar-plum to quieten the naughty child, a sacrifice to peace and\n",
      "quietness. Some were steadily and vehemently opposed to the dangerous precedent of yielding one jot\n",
      "or one tittle to the outward force of a turn-out. It was teaching the work-people how to become\n",
      "masters, said they. Did they want the wildest thing heareafter, they would know that the way to\n",
      "obtain their wishes would be to strike work. Besides, one or two of those present had only just\n",
      "returned from the New Bailey, where one of the turn-outs had been tried for a cruel assault on a\n",
      "poor north-country weaver, who had attempted to work at the low price. They were indignant, and\n",
      "justly so, at the merciless manner in which the poor fellow had been treated; and their indignation\n",
      "at wrong, took (as it so often does) the extreme form of revenge. They felt as if, rather than yield\n",
      "to the body of men who were resorting to such cruel measures towards their fellow-workmen, they, the\n",
      "masters, would sooner relinquish all the benefits to be derived from the fulfilment of the\n",
      "commission, in order that the workmen might suffer keenly. They forgot that the strike was in this\n",
      "instance the consequence of want and need, suffered unjustly, as the endurers believed; for, however\n",
      "insane, and without ground of reason, such was their belief, and such was the cause of their\n",
      "violence. It is a great truth, that you cannot extinguish violence by violence. You may put it down\n",
      "for a time; but while you are crowing over your imaginary success, see if it does not return with\n",
      "seven devils worse than its former self!</p>\n",
      "<p>No one thought of treating the workmen as brethren and friends, and openly, clearly, as appealing\n",
      "to reasonable men, stating the exact and full circumstances which led the masters to think it was\n",
      "the wise policy of the time to make sacrifices themselves, and to hope for them from the\n",
      "operatives.</p>\n",
      "<p>In going from group to group in the room, you caught such a medley of sentences as the\n",
      "following:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Poor devils! they're near enough to starving, I'm afraid. Mrs. Aldred makes two cows' heads into\n",
      "soup every week, and people come several miles to fetch it; and if these times last we must try and\n",
      "do more. But we must not be bullied into any thing!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"A rise of a shilling or so won't make much difference, and they will go away thinking they've\n",
      "gained their point.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's the very thing I object to. They'll think so, and whenever they've a point to gain, no\n",
      "matter how unreasonable, they'll strike work.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It really injures them more than us.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't see how our interests can be separated.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"The d——d brute had thrown vitriol on the poor fellow's ankles, and you know what a bad part that\n",
      "is to heal. He had to stand still with the pain, and that left him at the mercy of the cruel wretch,\n",
      "who beat him about the head till you'd hardly have known he was a man. They doubt if he'll\n",
      "live.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If it were only for that, I'll stand out against them, even if it were the cause of my\n",
      "ruin.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, I for one won't yield one farthing to the cruel brutes; they're more like wild beasts than\n",
      "human beings.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>(Well! who might have made them different?)</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I say, Carson, just go and tell Duncombe of this fresh instance of their abominable conduct.\n",
      "He's wavering, but I think this will decide him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The door was now opened, and a waiter announced that the men were below, and asked if it were the\n",
      "pleasure of the gentlemen that they should be shown up.</p>\n",
      "<p>They assented, and rapidly took their places round the official table; looking, as like as they\n",
      "could, to the Roman senators who awaited the irruption of Brennus and his Gauls.</p>\n",
      "<p>Tramp, tramp, came the heavy clogged feet up the stairs; and in a minute five wild,\n",
      "earnest-looking men stood in the room. John Barton, from some mistake as to time, was not among\n",
      "them. Had they been larger boned men, you would have called them gaunt; as it was, they were little\n",
      "of stature, and their fustian clothes hung loosely upon their shrunk limbs. In choosing their\n",
      "delegates, too, the operatives had had more regard to their brains, and power of speech, than to\n",
      "their wardrobes; they might have read the opinions of that worthy Professor Teufelsdruch, in Sartor\n",
      "Resartus, to judge from the dilapidated coats and trousers, which yet clothed men of parts and of\n",
      "power. It was long since many of them had known the luxury of a new article of dress; and air-gaps\n",
      "were to be seen in their garments. Some of the masters were rather affronted at such a ragged\n",
      "detachment coming between the wind and their nobility; but what cared they?</p>\n",
      "<p>At the request of a gentleman hastily chosen to officiate as chairman, the leader of the\n",
      "delegates read, in a high-pitched, psalm-singing voice, a paper, containing the operatives'\n",
      "statement of the case at issue, their complaints, and their demands, which last were not remarkable\n",
      "for moderation.</p>\n",
      "<p>He was then desired to withdraw for a few minutes, with his fellow delegates, to another room,\n",
      "while the masters considered what should be their definitive answer.</p>\n",
      "<p>When the men had left the room, a whispered earnest consultation took place, every one re-urging\n",
      "his former arguments. The conceders carried the day, but only by a majority of one. The minority\n",
      "haughtily and audibly expressed their dissent from the measures to be adopted, even after the\n",
      "delegates re-entered the room; their words and looks did not pass unheeded by the quick-eyed\n",
      "operatives; their names were registered in bitter hearts.</p>\n",
      "<p>The masters could not consent to the advance demanded by the workmen. They would agree to give\n",
      "one shilling per week more than they had previously offered. Were the delegates empowered to accept\n",
      "such offer?</p>\n",
      "<p>They were empowered to accept or decline any offer made that day by the masters.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then it might be as well for them to consult among themselves as to what should be their\n",
      "decision. They again withdrew.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was not for long. They came back, and positively declined any compromise of their demands.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then up sprang Mr. Henry Carson, the head and voice of the violent party among the masters, and\n",
      "addressing the chairman, even before the scowling operatives, he proposed some resolutions, which\n",
      "he, and those who agreed with him, had been concocting during this last absence of the\n",
      "deputation.</p>\n",
      "<p>They were, firstly, withdrawing the proposal just made, and declaring all communication between\n",
      "the masters and that particular Trades' Union at an end; secondly, declaring that no master would\n",
      "employ any workman in future, unless he signed a declaration that he did not belong to any Trades'\n",
      "Union, and pledged himself not to assist or subscribe to any society, having for its object\n",
      "interference with the masters' powers; and, thirdly, that the masters should pledge themselves to\n",
      "protect and encourage all workmen willing to accept employment on those conditions, and at the rate\n",
      "of wages first offered. Considering that the men who now stood listening with lowering brows of\n",
      "defiance were all of them leading members of the Union, such resolutions were in themselves\n",
      "sufficiently provocative of animosity: but not content with simply stating them, Harry Carson went\n",
      "on to characterise the conduct of the workmen in no measured terms; every word he spoke rendering\n",
      "their looks more livid, their glaring eyes more fierce. One among them would have spoken, but\n",
      "checked himself in obedience to the stern glance and pressure on his arm, received from the leader.\n",
      "Mr. Carson sat down, and a friend instantly got up to second the motion. It was carried, but far\n",
      "from unanimously. The chairman announced it to the delegates (who had been once more turned out of\n",
      "the room for a division). They received it with deep brooding silence, but spake never a word, and\n",
      "left the room without even a bow.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now there had been some by-play at this meeting, not recorded in the Manchester newspapers, which\n",
      "gave an account of the more regular part of the transaction.</p>\n",
      "<p>While the men had stood grouped near the door, on their first entrance, Mr. Harry Carson had\n",
      "taken out his silver pencil, and had drawn an admirable caricature of them—lank, ragged, dispirited,\n",
      "and famine-stricken. Underneath he wrote a hasty quotation from the fat knight's well-known speech\n",
      "in Henry IV. He passed it to one of his neighbours, who acknowledged the likeness instantly, and by\n",
      "him it was sent round to others, who all smiled and nodded their heads. When it came back to its\n",
      "owner he tore the back of the letter on which it was drawn, in two; twisted them up, and flung them\n",
      "into the fire-place; but, careless whether they reached their aim or not, he did not look to see\n",
      "that they fell just short of any consuming cinders.</p>\n",
      "<p>This proceeding was closely observed by one of the men.</p>\n",
      "<p>He watched the masters as they left the hotel (laughing, some of them were, at passing jokes),\n",
      "and when all had gone, he re-entered. He went to the waiter, who recognised him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"There's a bit on a picture up yonder, as one o' the gentlemen threw away; I've a little lad at\n",
      "home as dearly loves a picture; by your leave I'll go up for it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The waiter, good-natured and sympathetic, accompanied him up-stairs; saw the paper picked up and\n",
      "untwisted, and then being convinced, by a hasty glance at its contents, that it was only what the\n",
      "man had called it, \"a bit of a picture,\" he allowed him to bear away his prize.</p>\n",
      "<p>Towards seven o'clock that evening many operatives began to assemble in a room in the Weavers'\n",
      "Arms public-house, a room appropriated for \"festive occasions,\" as the landlord, in his circular, on\n",
      "opening the premises, had described it. But, alas! it was on no festive occasion that they met there\n",

      "morning given by the masters to their delegates; after which, as was stated in the notice, a\n",
      "gentleman from London would have the honour of addressing the meeting on the present state of\n",
      "affairs between the employers and the employed, or (as he chose to term them) the idle and the\n",
      "industrious classes. The room was not large, but its bareness of furniture made it appear so.\n",
      "Unshaded gas flared down upon the lean and unwashed artisans as they entered, their eyes blinking at\n",
      "the excess of light.</p>\n",
      "<p>They took their seats on benches, and awaited the deputation. The latter, gloomily and\n",
      "ferociously, delivered the masters' ultimatum, adding thereunto not one word of their own; and it\n",
      "sank all the deeper into the sore hearts of the listeners for their forbearance.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then the \"gentleman from London\" (who had been previously informed of the masters' decision)\n",
      "entered. You would have been puzzled to define his exact position, or what was the state of his mind\n",
      "as regarded education. He looked so self-conscious, so far from earnest, among the group of eager,\n",
      "fierce, absorbed men, among whom he now stood. He might have been a disgraced medical student of the\n",
      "Bob Sawyer class, or an unsuccessful actor, or a flashy shopman. The impression he would have given\n",
      "you would have been unfavourable, and yet there was much about him that could only be characterised\n",
      "as doubtful.</p>\n",
      "<p>He smirked in acknowledgment of their uncouth greetings, and sat down; then glancing round, he\n",
      "inquired whether it would not be agreeable to the gentlemen present to have pipes and liquor handed\n",
      "round; adding, that he would stand treat.</p>\n",
      "<p>As the man who has had his taste educated to love reading, falls devouringly upon books after a\n",
      "long abstinence, so these poor fellows, whose tastes had been left to educate themselves into a\n",
      "liking for tobacco, beer, and similar gratifications, gleamed up at the proposal of the London\n",
      "delegate. Tobacco and drink deaden the pangs of hunger, and make one forget the miserable home, the\n",
      "desolate future.</p>\n",
      "<p>They were now ready to listen to him with approbation. He felt it; and rising like a great\n",
      "orator, with his right arm outstretched, his left in the breast of his waistcoat, he began to\n",
      "declaim, with a forced theatrical voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>After a burst of eloquence, in which he blended the deeds of the elder and the younger Brutus,\n",
      "and magnified the resistless might of the \"millions of Manchester,\" the Londoner descended to\n",
      "matter-of-fact business, and in his capacity this way he did not belie the good judgment of those\n",
      "who had sent him as delegate. Masses of people, when left to their own free choice, seem to have\n",
      "discretion in distinguishing men of natural talent; it is a pity they so little regard temper and\n",
      "principles. He rapidly dictated resolutions, and suggested measures. He wrote out a stirring placard\n",
      "for the walls. He proposed sending delegates to entreat the assistance of other Trades' Unions in\n",
      "other towns. He headed the list of subscribing Unions, by a liberal donation from that with which he\n",
      "was especially connected in London; and what was more, and more uncommon, he paid down the money in\n",
      "real, clinking, blinking, golden sovereigns! The money, alas, was cravingly required; but before\n",
      "alleviating any private necessities on the morrow, small sums were handed to each of the delegates,\n",
      "who were in a day or two to set out on their expeditions to Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham, &amp;c.\n",
      "These men were most of them members of the deputation who had that morning waited upon the masters.\n",
      "After he had drawn up some letters, and spoken a few more stirring words, the gentleman from London\n",
      "withdrew, previously shaking hands all round; and many speedily followed him out of the room, and\n",
      "out of the house.</p>\n",
      "<p>The newly-appointed delegates, and one or two others, remained behind to talk over their\n",
      "respective missions, and to give and exchange opinions in more homely and natural language than they\n",
      "dared to use before the London orator.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He's a rare chap, yon,\" began one, indicating the departed delegate by a jerk of his thumb\n",
      "towards the door. \"He's gotten the gift of the gab, anyhow!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! ay! he knows what he's about. See how he poured it into us about that there Brutus. He were\n",
      "pretty hard, too, to kill his own son!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I could kill mine if he took part wi' the masters; to be sure, he's but a step-son, but that\n",
      "makes no odds,\" said another.</p>\n",
      "<p>But now tongues were hushed, and all eyes were directed towards the member of the deputation who\n",
      "had that morning returned to the hotel to obtain possession of Harry Carson's clever caricature of\n",
      "the operatives.</p>\n",
      "<p>The heads clustered together, to gaze at and detect the likenesses.</p>\n",

      "he had left them at home as would look for news, and hope and get none, but, haply, tidings of his\n",
      "death. Well, Jonas had thought on these things till he could not rest, but walked up and down\n",

      "none on us would ever throw vitriol again (at least at a knob-stick) if they could see the sight I\n",

      "axed his wife's name he shrieked out, 'Mary, Mary, shall I never see you again? Mary, my darling,\n",
      "they've made me blind because I wanted to work for you and our own baby; oh, Mary, Mary!' Then the\n",

      "<p>\"No! he went on talking to her, till his words cut my heart like a knife. I axed th' nurse to\n",
      "find out who she was, and where she lived. But what I'm more especial naming it now for is this,—for\n",
      "one thing I wanted yo all to know why I weren't at my post this morning; for another, I wish to say,\n",
      "that I, for one, ha' seen enough of what comes of attacking knob-sticks, and I'll ha nought to do\n",

      "<p>There were some expressions of disapprobation, but John did not mind them.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay! I'm no coward,\" he replied, \"and I'm true to th' backbone. What I would like, and what I\n",
      "would do, would be to fight the masters. There's one among yo called me a coward. Well! every man\n",
      "has a right to his opinion; but since I've thought on th' matter to-day, I've thought we han all on\n",

      "<p>\"Oh! I don't know. She seems so much better than I am! And her voice! When I hear it, and think\n",
      "of the wishes that are in my heart, it seems as much out of place to ask her to be my wife, as it\n",
      "would be to ask an angel from heaven.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary could not help laughing outright, in spite of her depression, at the idea of Margaret as an\n",
      "angel; it was so difficult (even to her dress-making imagination) to fancy where, and how, the wings\n",
      "would be fastened to the brown stuff gown, or the blue and yellow print.</p>\n",
      "<p>Will laughed, too, a little, out of sympathy with Mary's pretty merry laugh. Then he said—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, you may laugh, Mary; it only shows you've never been in love.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>In an instant Mary was carnation colour, and the tears sprang to her soft gray eyes; she was\n",
      "suffering so much from the doubts arising from love! It was unkind of him. He did not notice her\n",
      "change of look and of complexion. He only noticed that she was silent, so he continued:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I thought—I think, that when I come back from this voyage, I will speak. It's my fourth voyage\n",
      "in the same ship, and with the same captain, and he's promised he'll make me second mate after this\n",
      "trip; then I shall have something to offer Margaret; and her grandfather, and aunt Alice, shall live\n",
      "with her, to keep her from being lonesome while I'm at sea. I'm speaking as if she cared for me, and\n",
      "would marry me; d'ye think she does care at all for me, Mary?\" asked he, anxiously.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary had a very decided opinion of her own on the subject, but she did not feel as if she had any\n",
      "right to give it. So she said—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You must ask Margaret, not me, Will; she's never named your name to me.\" His countenance fell.\n",
      "\"But I should say that was a good sign from a girl like her. I've no right to say what I think; but,\n",
      "if I was you, I would not leave her now without speaking.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! I cannot speak! I have tried. I've been in to wish them good-bye, and my voice stuck in my\n",
      "throat. I could say nought of what I'd planned to say; and I never thought of being so bold as to\n",
      "offer her marriage till I'd been my next trip, and been made mate. I could not even offer her this\n",
      "box,\" said he, undoing his paper parcel and displaying a gaudily ornamented accordion; \"I longed to\n",

      "used to plan how we would go sometime, please God (that was always her word), and live near her old\n",
      "home beyond Lancaster; in the very cottage where she was born if we could get it. Dear! and how\n",
      "different it is! Here is she still in a back street o' Manchester, never likely to see her own home\n",

      "<p>\"She would may be have found all sadly changed,\" said Mary, though her heart echoed Will's\n",

      "<p>\"Ay! ay! I dare say it's best. One thing I do wish though, and I have often wished it when out\n",
      "alone on the deep sea, when even the most thoughtless can't choose but think on th' past and th'\n",

      "gone on speaking. But John answered abruptly,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Good bye to ye, then.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was that in his manner which left no doubt of his desire to get rid of the visitor, and\n",
      "Will accordingly shook hands with Mary, and looked at John, as if doubting how far to offer to shake\n",
      "hands with him. But he met with no answering glance or gesture, so he went his way, stopping for an\n",
      "instant at the door to say,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You'll think on me on Tuesday, Mary. That's the day we shall hoist our blue Peter, Jack Harris\n",
      "says.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary was heartily sorry when the door closed; it seemed like shutting out a friendly sunbeam. And\n",
      "her father! what could be the matter with him? He was so restless; not speaking (she wished he\n",
      "would), but starting up and then sitting down, and meddling with her irons; he seemed so fierce,\n",
      "too, to judge from his face. She wondered if he disliked Will being there; or if he were vexed to\n",
      "find that she had not got further on with her work. At last she could bear his nervous way no\n",
      "longer, it made her equally nervous and fidgetty. She would speak.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When are you going, father? I don't know the time o' the trains.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And why shouldst thou know?\" replied he, gruffly. \"Meddle with thy ironing, but donnot be asking\n",
      "questions about what doesn't concern thee.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wanted to get you something to eat first,\" answered she, gently.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou dost not know that I'm larning to do without food,\" said he.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary looked at him to see if he spoke jestingly. No! he looked savagely grave.</p>\n",
      "<p>She finished her bit of ironing, and began preparing the food she was sure her father needed; for\n",
      "by this time her experience in the degrees of hunger had taught her that his present irritability\n",
      "was increased, if not caused, by want of food.</p>\n",
      "<p>He had had a sovereign given him to pay his expenses as delegate to Glasgow, and out of this he\n",
      "had given Mary a few shillings in the morning; so she had been able to buy a sufficient meal, and\n",
      "now her care was to cook it so as most to tempt him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If thou'rt doing that for me, Mary, thou may'st spare thy labour. I telled thee I were not for\n",
      "eating.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Just a little bit, father, before starting,\" coaxed Mary, perseveringly.</p>\n",
      "<p>At that instant, who should come in but Job Legh. It was not often he came, but when he did pay\n",
      "visits, Mary knew from past experience they were any thing but short. Her father's countenance fell\n",
      "back into the deep gloom from which it was but just emerging at the sound of Mary's sweet voice, and\n",
      "pretty pleading. He became again restless and fidgetty, scarcely giving Job Legh the greeting\n",
      "necessary for a host in his own house. Job, however, did not stand upon ceremony. He had come to pay\n",
      "a visit, and was not to be daunted from his purpose. He was interested in John Barton's mission to\n",
      "Glasgow, and wanted to hear all about it; so he sat down, and made himself comfortable, in a manner\n",
      "that Mary saw was meant to be stationary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So thou'rt off to Glasgow, art thou?\" he began his catechism.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When art starting?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To-night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That I knowed. But by what train?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>That was just what Mary wanted to know; but what apparently her father was in no mood to tell. He\n",
      "got up without speaking, and went up-stairs. Mary knew from his step, and his way, how much he was\n",
      "put out, and feared Job would see it, too. But no! Job seemed imperturbable. So much the better, and\n",
      "perhaps she could cover her father's rudeness by her own civility to so kind a friend.</p>\n",
      "<p>So half listening to her father's movements up-stairs, (passionate, violent, restless motions\n",
      "they were) and half attending to Job Legh, she tried to pay him all due regard.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When does thy father start, Mary?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>That plaguing question again.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! very soon. I'm just getting him a bit of supper. Is Margaret very well?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, she's well enough. She's meaning to go and keep Alice Wilson company for an hour or so this\n",
      "evening; as soon as she thinks her nephew will have started for Liverpool; for she fancies the old\n",
      "woman will feel a bit lonesome. Th' Union is paying for your father, I suppose?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, they've given him a sovereign. You're one of th' Union, Job?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! I'm one, sure enough; but I'm but a sleeping partner in the concern. I were obliged to\n",
      "become a member for peace, else I don't go along with 'em. Yo see they think themselves wise, and me\n",
      "silly, for differing with them; well! there's no harm in that. But then they won't let me be silly\n",
      "in peace and quietness, but will force me to be as wise as they are; now that's not British liberty,\n",
      "I say. I'm forced to be wise according to their notions, else they parsecute me, and sarve me\n",
      "out.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>What could her father be doing up-stairs? Tramping and banging about. Why did he not come down?\n",
      "Or why did not Job go? The supper would be spoilt.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Job had no notion of going.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You see my folly is this, Mary. I would take what I could get; I think half a loaf is better\n",
      "than no bread. I would work for low wages rather than sit idle and starve. But, comes the Trades'\n",
      "Union, and says, 'Well, if you take the half-loaf, we'll worry you out of your life. Will you be\n",
      "clemmed, or will you be worried?' Now clemming is a quiet death, and worrying isn't, so I choose\n",
      "clemming, and come into th' Union. But I wish they'd leave me free, if I am a fool.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Creak, creak, went the stairs. Her father was coming down at last.</p>\n",
      "<p>Yes, he came down, but more doggedly fierce than before, and made up for his journey, too; with\n",
      "his little bundle on his arm. He went up to Job, and, more civilly than Mary expected, wished him\n",
      "good-bye. He then turned to her, and in a short cold manner, bade her farewell.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! father, don't go yet. Your supper is all ready. Stay one moment!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But he pushed her away, and was gone. She followed him to the door, her eyes blinded by sudden\n",
      "tears; she stood there looking after him. He was so strange, so cold, so hard. Suddenly, at the end\n",
      "of the court, he turned, and saw her standing there; he came back quickly, and took her in his\n",
      "arms.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"God bless thee, Mary!—God in heaven bless thee, poor child!\" She threw her arms round his\n",
      "neck.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't go yet, father; I can't bear you to go yet. Come in, and eat some supper; you look so\n",
      "ghastly; dear father, do!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No,\" he said, faintly and mournfully. \"It's best as it is. I couldn't eat, and it's best to be\n",
      "off. I cannot be still at home. I must be moving.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So saying, he unlaced her soft twining arms, and kissing her once more, set off on his fierce\n",
      "errand.</p>\n",
      "<p>And he was out of sight! She did not know why, but she had never before felt so depressed, so\n",
      "desolate. She turned in to Job, who sat there still. Her father, as soon as he was out of sight,\n",
      "slackened his pace, and fell into that heavy listless step, which told as well as words could do, of\n",
      "hopelessness and weakness. It was getting dark, but he loitered on, returning no greeting to any\n",
      "one.</p>\n",
      "<p>A child's cry caught his ear. His thoughts were running on little Tom; on the dead and buried\n",
      "child of happier years. He followed the sound of the wail, that might have been <hi>his</hi>, and\n",
      "found a poor little mortal, who had lost his way, and whose grief had choked up his thoughts to the\n",
      "single want, \"Mammy, mammy.\" With tender address, John Barton soothed the little laddie, and with\n",
      "beautiful patience he gathered fragments of meaning from the half spoken words which came mingled\n",
      "with sobs from the terrified little heart. So, aided by inquiries here and there from a passer-by,\n",
      "he led and carried the little fellow home, where his mother had been too busy to miss him, but now\n",
      "received him with thankfulness, and with an eloquent Irish blessing. When John heard the words of\n",
      "blessing, he shook his head mournfully, and turned away to retrace his steps.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let us leave him.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary took her sewing after he had gone, and sat on, and sat on, trying to listen to Job, who was\n",
      "more inclined to talk than usual. She had conquered her feeling of impatience towards him so far as\n",
      "to be able to offer him her father's rejected supper; and she even tried to eat herself. But her\n",
      "heart failed her. A leaden weight seemed to hang over her; a sort of presentiment of evil, or\n",
      "perhaps only an excess of low-spirited feeling in consequence of the two departures which had taken\n",
      "place that afternoon.</p>\n",
      "<p>She wondered how long Job Legh would sit. She did not like putting down her work, and crying\n",
      "before him, and yet she had never in her life longed so much to be alone in order to indulge in a\n",
      "good hearty burst of tears.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Mary,\" she suddenly caught him saying, \"I thought you'd be a bit lonely to-night; and as\n",
      "Margaret were going to cheer th' old woman, I said I'd go and keep th' young un company; and a very\n",
      "pleasant, chatty evening we've had; very. Only I wonder as Margaret is not come back.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But perhaps she is,\" suggested Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, no, I took care o' that. Look ye here!\" and he pulled out the great house-key. \"She'll have\n",
      "to stand waiting i' th' street, and that I'm sure she wouldn't do, when she knew where to find\n",
      "me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Will she come back by hersel?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay. At first I were afraid o' trusting her, and I used to follow her a bit behind; never letting\n",
      "on, of course. But, bless you! she goes along as steadily as can be; rather slow, to be sure, and\n",
      "her head a bit on one side as if she were listening. And it's real beautiful to see her cross the\n",
      "road. She'll wait above a bit to hear that all is still; not that she's so dark as not to see a\n",
      "coach or a cart like a big black thing, but she can't rightly judge how far off it is by sight, so\n",
      "she listens. Hark! that's her!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Yes; in she came with her usually calm face all tear-stained and sorrow-marked.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What's the matter, my wench?\" said Job, hastily.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! grandfather! Alice Wilson's so bad!\" She could say no more, for her breathless agitation.\n",
      "The afternoon, and the parting with Will, had weakened her nerves for any after-shock.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What is it? Do tell us, Margaret!\" said Mary, placing her in a chair, and loosening her\n",
      "bonnet-strings.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I think it's a stroke o' the palsy. Any rate she has lost the use of one side.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Was it afore Will had set off?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No; he were gone before I got there,\" said Margaret; \"and she were much about as well as she has\n",
      "been this many a day. She spoke a bit, but not much; but that were only natural, for Mrs. Wilson\n",
      "likes to have the talk to hersel, you know. She got up to go across the room, and then I heard a\n",
      "drag wi' her leg, and presently a fall, and Mrs. Wilson came running, and set up such a cry! I\n",
      "stopped wi' Alice, while she fetched a doctor; but she could not speak, to answer me, though she\n",
      "tried, I think.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where was Jem? Why didn't he go for the doctor?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He were out when I got there, and he never came home while I stopped.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou'st never left Mrs. Wilson alone wi' poor Alice?\" asked Job, hastily.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, no,\" said Margaret. \"But, oh! grandfather; it's now I feel how hard it is to have lost my\n",
      "sight. I should have so loved to nurse her; and I did try, until I found I did more harm than good.\n",
      "Oh! grandfather; if I could but see!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She sobbed a little; and they let her give that ease to her heart. Then she went on—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! I went round by Mrs. Davenport's, and she were hard at work; but, the minute I told my\n",
      "errand, she were ready and willing to go to Jane Wilson, and stop up all night with Alice.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And what does the doctor say?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! much what all doctors say: he puts a fence on this side, and a fence on that, for fear he\n",
      "should be caught tripping in his judgment. One moment he does not think there's much hope—but while\n",
      "there is life there is hope; th' next he says he should think she might recover partial, but her age\n",
      "is again her. He's ordered her leeches to her head.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret, having told her tale, leant back with weariness, both of body and mind. Mary hastened\n",
      "to make her a cup of tea; while Job, lately so talkative, sat quiet and mournfully silent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll go first thing to-morrow morning, and learn how she is; and I'll bring word back before I\n",
      "go to work,\" said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's a bad job Will's gone,\" said Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jane does not think she knows any one,\" replied Margaret. \"It's perhaps as well he shouldn't see\n",

      "<p>With a few more sorrowful remarks they separated for the night, and Mary was left alone in her\n",

      "Will gone; her father gone—and so strangely too! And to a place so mysteriously distant as Glasgow\n",

      "<p>\"Well, then!\" said Sophy, indignantly, \"though it is our own brother, I do think he is behaving\n",
      "very wrongly. The more I think of it the more sure I am that she thinks he means something, and that\n",
      "he intends her to think so. And then, when he leaves off paying her attention—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Which will be as soon as a prettier girl makes her appearance,\" interrupted Helen.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"As soon as he leaves off paying her attention,\" resumed Sophy, \"she will have many and many a\n",
      "heart-ache, and then she will harden herself into being a flirt, a feminine flirt, as he is a\n",
      "masculine flirt. Poor girl!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't like to hear you speak so of Harry,\" said Amy, looking up at Sophy.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And I don't like to have to speak so, Amy, for I love him dearly. He is a good, kind brother,\n",
      "but I do think him vain, and I think he hardly knows the misery, the crimes, to which indulged\n",
      "vanity may lead him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Helen yawned.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! do you think we may ring for tea? Sleeping after dinner always makes me so feverish.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, surely. Why should not we?\" said the more energetic Sophy, pulling the bell with some\n",
      "determination.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tea directly, Parker,\" said she, authoritatively, as the man entered the room.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was too little in the habit of reading expressions on the faces of others to notice Parker's\n",
      "countenance.</p>\n",
      "<p>Yet it was striking. It was blanched to a dead whiteness; the lips compressed as if to keep\n",
      "within some tale of horror; the eyes distended and unnatural. It was a terror-stricken face.</p>\n",
      "<p>The girls began to put away their music and books, in preparation for tea. The door slowly opened\n",
      "again, and this time it was the nurse who entered. I call her nurse, for such had been her office in\n",
      "by-gone days, though now she held rather an anomalous situation in the family. Seamstress, attendant\n",
      "on the young ladies, keeper of the stores; only \"Nurse\" was still her name. She had lived longer\n",
      "with them than any other servant, and to her their manner was far less haughty than to the other\n",
      "domestics. She occasionally came into the drawing-room to look for things belonging to their father\n",
      "or mother, so it did not excite any surprise when she advanced into the room. They went on arranging\n",
      "their various articles of employment.</p>\n",
      "<p>She wanted them to look up. She wanted them to read something in her face—her face so full of\n",
      "woe, of horror. But they went on without taking any notice. She coughed; not a natural cough; but\n",
      "one of those coughs which ask so plainly for remark.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear nurse, what is the matter?\" asked Amy. \"Are not you well?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is mamma ill?\" asked Sophy, quickly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Speak, speak, nurse!\" said they all, as they saw her efforts to articulate, choked by the\n",
      "convulsive rising in her throat. They clustered round her with eager faces, catching a glimpse of\n",
      "some terrible truth to be revealed.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My dear young ladies! my dear girls,\" she gasped out at length, and then she burst into\n",
      "tears.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! do tell us what it is, nurse,\" said one. \"Any thing is better than this. Speak!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My children! I don't know how to break it to you. My dears, poor Mr. Harry is brought home—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Brought home—<hi>brought</hi> home—how?\" Instinctively they sank their voices to a whisper; but\n",
      "a fearful whisper it was. In the same low tone, as if afraid lest the walls, the furniture, the\n",
      "inanimate things which told of preparation for life and comfort, should hear, she answered,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dead!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Amy clutched her nurse's arm, and fixed her eyes on her as if to know if such a tale could be\n",
      "true; and when she read its confirmation in those sad, mournful, unflinching eyes, she sank, without\n",
      "word or sound, down in a faint upon the floor. One sister sat down on an ottoman, and covered her\n",
      "face, to try and realise it. That was Sophy. Helen threw herself on the sofa, and burying her head\n",
      "in the pillows, tried to stifle the screams and moans which shook her frame.</p>\n",
      "<p>The nurse stood silent. She had not told <hi>all</hi>.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tell me,\" said Sophy, looking up, and speaking in a hoarse voice, which told of the inward pain,\n",
      "\"tell me, nurse! Is he <hi>dead</hi>, did you say? Have you sent for a doctor? Oh! send for one,\n",
      "send for one,\" continued she, her voice rising to shrillness, and starting to her feet. Helen lifted\n",
      "herself up, and looked, with breathless waiting, towards nurse.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My dears, he is dead! But I have sent for a doctor. I have done all I could.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"When did he—when did they bring him home?\" asked Sophy.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Perhaps ten minutes ago. Before you rang for Parker.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How did he die? Where did they find him? He looked so well. He always seemed so strong. Oh! are\n",
      "you sure he is dead?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She went towards the door. Nurse laid her hand on her arm.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Miss Sophy, I have not told you all. Can you bear to hear it? Remember, master is in the next\n",
      "room, and he knows nothing yet. Come, you must help me to tell him. Now be quiet, dear! It was no\n",
      "common death he died!\" She looked in her face as if trying to convey her meaning by her eyes.</p>\n",
      "<p>Sophy's lips moved, but nurse could hear no sound.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He has been shot as he was coming home along Turner Street, to-night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Sophy went on with the motion of her lips, twitching them almost convulsively.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My dear, you must rouse yourself, and remember your father and mother have yet to be told.\n",
      "Speak! Miss Sophy!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But she could not; her whole face worked involuntarily. The nurse left the room, and almost\n",
      "immediately brought back some sal-volatile and water. Sophy drank it eagerly, and gave one or two\n",
      "deep gasps. Then she spoke in a calm unnatural voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What do you want me to do, nurse? Go to Helen and poor Amy. See, they want help.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Poor creatures! we must let them alone for a bit. You must go to master; that's what I want you\n",
      "to do, Miss Sophy. You must break it to him, poor old gentleman. Come, he's asleep in the\n",
      "dining-room, and the men are waiting to speak to him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Sophy went mechanically to the dining-room door.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! I cannot go in. I cannot tell him. What must I say?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll come with you, Miss Sophy. Break it to him by degrees.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I can't, nurse. My head throbs so, I shall be sure to say the wrong thing.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>However, she opened the door. There sat her father, the shaded light of the candle-lamp falling\n",
      "upon, and softening his marked features, while his snowy hair contrasted well with the deep crimson\n",
      "morocco of the chair. The newspaper he had been reading had dropped on the carpet by his side. He\n",
      "breathed regularly and deeply.</p>\n",
      "<p>At that instant the words of Mrs. Hemans's song came full into Sophy's mind.</p>\n",
      "<quote><l>\"Ye know not what ye do,</l><l>That call the slumberer back</l><l>From the realms unseen\n",
      "by you,</l><l>To life's dim, weary track.\"</l></quote>\n",
      "<p>But this life's track would be to the bereaved father something more than dim and weary,\n",
      "hereafter.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Papa,\" said she, softly. He did not stir.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Papa!\" she exclaimed, somewhat louder.</p>\n",
      "<p>He started up, half awake.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tea is ready, is it?\" and he yawned.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! papa, but something very dreadful—very sad, has happened!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He was gaping so loud that he did not catch the words she uttered, and did not see the expression\n",
      "of her face.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Master Henry is not come back,\" said nurse. Her voice, heard in unusual speech to him, arrested\n",
      "his attention, and rubbing his eyes, he looked at the servant.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Harry! oh no! he had to attend a meeting of the masters about these cursed turn-outs. I don't\n",
      "expect him yet. What are you looking at me so strangely for, Sophy?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, papa, Harry is come back,\" said she, bursting into tears.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What do you mean?\" said he, startled into an impatient consciousness that something was wrong.\n",
      "\"One of you says he is not come home, and the other says he is. Now that's nonsense! Tell me at once\n",
      "what's the matter. Did he go on horseback to town? Is he thrown? Speak, child, can't you?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! he's not been thrown, papa,\" said Sophy, sadly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But he's badly hurt,\" put in the nurse, desirous to be drawing his anxiety to a point.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Hurt? Where? How? Have you sent for a doctor?\" said he, hastily rising, as if to leave the\n",
      "room.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, papa, we've sent for a doctor—but I'm afraid—I believe it's of no use.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He looked at her for a moment, and in her face he read the truth. His son, his only son, was\n",
      "dead.</p>\n",
      "<p>He sank back in his chair, and hid his face in his hands, and bowed his head upon the table. The\n",
      "strong mahogany dining-table shook and rattled under his agony.</p>\n",
      "<p>Sophy went and put her arms round his bowed neck.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Go! you are not Harry,\" said he; but the action roused him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where is he? where is the—\" said he, with his strong face set into the lines of anguish, by two\n",
      "minutes of such intense woe.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"In the servants' hall,\" said nurse. \"Two policemen and another man brought him home. They would\n",
      "be glad to speak to you when you are able, sir.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I am able now,\" replied he. At first when he stood up, he tottered. But steadying himself, he\n",
      "walked, as firmly as a soldier on drill, to the door. Then he turned back and poured out a glass of\n",
      "wine from the decanter which yet remained on the table. His eye caught the wine-glass which Harry\n",
      "had used but two or three hours before. He sighed a long quivering sigh. And then mastering himself\n",
      "again, he left the room.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You had better go back to your sisters, Miss Sophy,\" said nurse.</p>\n",
      "<p>Miss Carson went. She could not face death yet.</p>\n",
      "<p>The nurse followed Mr. Carson to the servants' hall. There, on their dinner-table, lay the poor\n",
      "dead body. The men who had brought it were sitting near the fire, while several of the servants\n",
      "stood round the table, gazing at the remains.</p>\n",
      "<p><hi>The remains!</hi></p>\n",
      "<p>One or two were crying; one or two were whispering; awed into a strange stillness of voice and\n",
      "action by the presence of the dead. When Mr. Carson came in they all drew back and looked at him\n",
      "with the reverence due to sorrow.</p>\n",
      "<p>He went forward and gazed long and fondly on the calm, dead face; then he bent down and kissed\n",
      "the lips yet crimson with life. The policemen had advanced and stood ready to be questioned. But at\n",
      "first the old man's mind could only take in the idea of death; slowly, slowly came the conception of\n",
      "violence, of murder. \"How did he die?\" he groaned forth.</p>\n",
      "<p>The policemen looked at each other. Then one began, and stated that having heard the report of a\n",
      "gun in Turner Street, he had turned down that way (a lonely, unfrequented way Mr. Carson knew, but a\n",
      "short cut to his garden-door, of which Harry had a key); that as he (the policeman) came nearer, he\n",
      "had heard footsteps as of a man running away; but the evening was so dark (the moon not having yet\n",
      "risen) that he could see no one twenty yards off. That he had even been startled when close to the\n",
      "body by seeing it lying across the path at his feet. That he had sprung his rattle; and when another\n",
      "policeman came up, by the light of the lantern they had discovered who it was that had been killed.\n",
      "That they believed him to be dead when they first took him up, as he had never moved, spoken, or\n",
      "breathed. That intelligence of the murder had been sent to the superintendent, who would probably\n",
      "soon be here. That two or three policemen were still about the place where the murder was committed,\n",
      "seeking out for some trace of the murderer. Having said this, they stopped speaking.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson had listened attentively, never taking his eyes off the dead body. When they had\n",
      "ended, he said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where was he shot?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They lifted up some of the thick chestnut curls, and showed a blue spot (you could hardly call it\n",
      "a hole, the flesh had closed so much over it) in the left temple. A deadly aim! And yet it was so\n",
      "dark a night!</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He must have been close upon him,\" said one policeman.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And have had him between him and the sky,\" added the other.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a little commotion at the door of the room, and there stood poor Mrs. Carson, the\n",
      "mother.</p>\n",
      "<p>She had heard unusual noises in the house, and had sent down her maid (much more a companion to\n",
      "her than her highly-educated daughters) to discover what was going on. But the maid either forgot,\n",
      "or dreaded, to return; and with nervous impatience Mrs. Carson came down herself, and had traced the\n",
      "hum and buzz of voices to the servants' hall.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson turned round. But he could not leave the dead for any one living.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Take her away, nurse. It is no sight for her. Tell Miss Sophy to go to her mother.\" His eyes\n",
      "were again fixed on the dead face of his son.</p>\n",
      "<p>Presently Mrs. Carson's hysterical cries were heard all over the house. Her husband shuddered at\n",
      "the outward expression of the agony which was rending his heart.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then the police superintendent came, and after him the doctor. The latter went through all the\n",
      "forms of ascertaining death, without uttering a word, and when at the conclusion of the operation of\n",
      "opening a vein, from which no blood flowed, he shook his head, all present understood the\n",
      "confirmation of their previous belief. The superintendent asked to speak to Mr. Carson in\n",
      "private.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It was just what I was going to request of you,\" answered he; so he led the way into the\n",
      "dining-room, with the wine-glass still on the table.</p>\n",
      "<p>The door was carefully shut, and both sat down, each apparently waiting for the other to\n",
      "begin.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last Mr. Carson spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You probably have heard that I am a rich man.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The superintendent bowed in assent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, sir, half—nay, if necessary, the whole of my fortune I will give to have the murderer\n",
      "brought to the gallows.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Every exertion, you may be sure, sir, shall be used on our part; but probably offering a\n",
      "handsome reward might accelerate the discovery of the murderer. But what I wanted particularly to\n",
      "tell you, sir, is that one of my men has already got some clue, and that another (who accompanied me\n",
      "here) has within this quarter of an hour found a gun in the field which the murderer crossed, and\n",
      "which he probably threw away when pursued, as encumbering his flight. I have not the smallest doubt\n",
      "of discovering the murderer.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What do you call a handsome reward?\" said Mr. Carson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, sir, three, or five hundred pounds is a munificent reward: more than will probably be\n",
      "required as a temptation to any accomplice.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Make it a thousand,\" said Mr. Carson, decisively. \"It's the doing of those damned\n",
      "turn-outs.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I imagine not,\" said the superintendent. \"Some days ago the man I was naming to you before,\n",
      "reported to the inspector when he came on his beat, that he had had to separate your son from a\n",
      "young man, who by his dress he believed to be employed in a foundry; that the man had thrown Mr.\n",
      "Carson down, and seemed inclined to proceed to more violence, when the policeman came up and\n",
      "interfered. Indeed, my man wished to give him in charge for an assault, but Mr. Carson would not\n",
      "allow that to be done.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Just like him!—noble fellow!\" murmured the father.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But after your son had left, the man made use of some pretty strong threats. And it's rather a\n",
      "curious coincidence that this scuffle took place in the very same spot where the murder was\n",
      "committed; in Turner Street.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was some one knocking at the door of the room. It was Sophy, who beckoned her father out,\n",
      "and then asked him, in an awe-struck whisper, to come up-stairs and speak to her mother.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She will not leave Harry, and talks so strangely. Indeed—indeed—papa, I think she has lost her\n",
      "senses.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And the poor girl sobbed bitterly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where is she?\" asked Mr. Carson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"In his room.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They went up stairs rapidly and silently. It was a large, comfortable bedroom; too large to be\n",
      "well lighted by the flaring, flickering kitchen-candle which had been hastily snatched up, and now\n",
      "stood on the dressing-table.</p>\n",
      "<p>On the bed, surrounded by its heavy, pall-like green curtains, lay the dead son. They had carried\n",
      "him up, and laid him down, as tenderly as though they feared to waken him; and, indeed, it looked\n",
      "more like sleep than death, so very calm and full of repose was the face. You saw, too, the\n",
      "chiselled beauty of the features much more perfectly than when the brilliant colouring of life had\n",
      "distracted your attention. There was a peace about him which told that death had come too\n",
      "instantaneously to give any previous pain.</p>\n",
      "<p>In a chair, at the head of the bed, sat the mother,—smiling. She held one of the hands (rapidly\n",
      "stiffening, even in her warm grasp), and gently stroked the back of it, with the endearing caress\n",
      "she had used to all her children when young.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I am glad you are come,\" said she, looking up at her husband, and still smiling. \"Harry is so\n",
      "full of fun, he always has something new to amuse us with; and now he pretends he is asleep, and\n",
      "that we can't waken him. Look! he is smiling now; he hears I have found him out. Look!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And, in truth, the lips, in the rest of death, did look as though they wore a smile, and the\n",
      "waving light of the unsnuffed candle almost made them seem to move.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Look, Amy,\" said she to her youngest child, who knelt at her feet, trying to soothe her, by\n",
      "kissing her garments.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, he was always a rogue! You remember, don't you, love? how full of play he was as a baby;\n",
      "hiding his face under my arm, when you wanted to play with him. Always a rogue, Harry!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"We must get her away, sir,\" said nurse; \"you know there is much to be done before—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I understand, nurse,\" said the father, hastily interrupting her in dread of the distinct words\n",
      "which would tell of the changes of mortality.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come, love,\" said he to his wife. \"I want you to come with me. I want to speak to you\n",
      "down-stairs.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm coming,\" said she, rising; \"perhaps, after all, nurse, he's really tired, and would be glad\n",
      "to sleep. Don't let him get cold, though,—he feels rather chilly,\" continued she, after she had bent\n",
      "down, and kissed the pale lips.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her husband put his arm round her waist, and they left the room. Then the three sisters burst\n",
      "into unrestrained wailings. They were startled into the reality of life and death. And yet, in the\n",
      "midst of shrieks and moans, of shivering, and chattering of teeth, Sophy's eye caught the calm\n",
      "beauty of the dead; so calm amidst such violence, and she hushed her emotion.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come,\" said she to her sisters, \"nurse wants us to go; and besides, we ought to be with mamma.\n",
      "Papa told the man he was talking to, when I went for him, to wait, and she must not be left.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, the superintendent had taken a candle, and was examining the engravings that hung\n",
      "round the dining-room. It was so common to him to be acquainted with crime, that he was far from\n",
      "feeling all his interest absorbed in the present case of violence, although he could not help having\n",
      "much anxiety to detect the murderer. He was busy looking at the only oil-painting in the room (a\n",
      "youth of eighteen or so, in a fancy dress), and conjecturing its identity with the young man so\n",
      "mysteriously dead, when the door opened, and Mr. Carson returned. Stern as he had looked before\n",
      "leaving the room, he looked far sterner now. His face was hardened into deep-purposed wrath.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I beg your pardon, sir, for leaving you.\" The superintendent bowed. They sat down, and spoke\n",
      "long together. One by one the policemen were called in, and questioned.</p>\n",
      "<p>All through the night there was bustle and commotion in the house. Nobody thought of going to\n",
      "bed. It seemed strange to Sophy to hear nurse summoned from her mother's side to supper, in the\n",
      "middle of the night, and still stranger that she could go. The necessity of eating and drinking\n",
      "seemed out of place in the house of death.</p>\n",
      "<p>When night was passing into morning, the dining-room door opened, and two persons' steps were\n",
      "heard along the hall. The superintendent was leaving at last. Mr. Carson stood on the front\n",
      "door-step, feeling the refreshment of the cooler morning air, and seeing the starlight fade away\n",
      "into dawn.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You will not forget,\" said he. \"I trust to you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The policeman bowed.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Spare no money. The only purpose for which I now value wealth is to have the murderer arrested,\n",
      "and brought to justice. My hope in life now is to see him sentenced to death. Offer any rewards.\n",

      "haunted with depressing thoughts. All through the night she tossed restlessly about, trying to get\n",
      "quit of the ideas that harassed her, and longing for the light when she could rise, and find some\n",
      "employment. But just as dawn began to appear, she became more quiet, and fell into a sound heavy\n",
      "sleep, which lasted till she was sure it was late in the morning by the full light that shone\n",
      "in.</p>\n",
      "<p>She dressed hastily, and heard the neighbouring church-clock strike eight. It was far too late to\n",
      "do as she had planned (after inquiring how Alice was, to return and tell Margaret), and she\n",
      "accordingly went in to inform the latter of her change of purpose, and the cause of it; but on\n",
      "entering the house she found Job sitting alone, looking sad enough. She told him what she came\n",
      "for.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Margaret, wench! why she's been gone to Wilson's these two hours. Ay! sure, you did say last\n",
      "night you would go; but she could na rest in her bed, so was off betimes this morning.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary could do nothing but feel guilty of her long morning nap, and hasten to follow Margaret's\n",
      "steps; for late as it was, she felt she could not settle well to her work, unless she learnt how\n",
      "kind good Alice Wilson was going on.</p>\n",
      "<p>So, eating her crust-of-bread breakfast, she passed rapidly along the streets. She remembered\n",
      "afterwards the little groups of people she had seen, eagerly hearing, and imparting news; but at the\n",
      "time her only care was to hasten on her way, in dread of a reprimand from Miss Simmonds.</p>\n",
      "<p>She went into the house at Jane Wilson's, her heart at the instant giving a strange knock, and\n",
      "sending the rosy flush into her face, at the thought that Jem might possibly be inside the door. But\n",
      "I do assure you, she had not thought of it before. Impatient and loving as she was, her solicitude\n",
      "about Alice on that hurried morning had not been mingled with any thought of him.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her heart need not have leaped, her colour need not have rushed so painfully to her cheeks, for\n",
      "he was not there. There was the round table, with a cup and saucer, which had evidently been used,\n",
      "and there was Jane Wilson sitting on the other side, crying quietly, while she ate her breakfast\n",
      "with a sort of unconscious appetite. And there was Mrs. Davenport washing away at a night-cap or so,\n",
      "which, by their simple, old-world make, Mary knew at a glance were Alice's. But nothing—no one\n",
      "else.</p>\n",
      "<p>Alice was much the same, or rather better of the two, they told her; at any rate she could speak,\n",
      "though it was sad rambling talk. Would Mary like to see her?</p>\n",
      "<p>Of course she would. Many are interested by seeing their friends under the new aspect of illness;\n",
      "and among the poor there is no wholesome fear of injury or excitement to restrain this wish.</p>\n",
      "<p>So Mary went up-stairs, accompanied by Mrs. Davenport, wringing the suds off her hands, and\n",
      "speaking in a loud whisper far more audible than her usual voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I mun be hastening home, but I'll come again to-night, time enough to iron her cap; 'twould be a\n",
      "sin and a shame if we let her go dirty now she's ill, when she's been so rare and clean all her\n",
      "life-long. But she's sadly forsaken, poor thing! She'll not know you, Mary; she knows none on\n",

      "Davenport returned to her washing.</p>\n",
      "<p>The two girls did not speak; the presence of Alice awed them into silence. There she lay with the\n",
      "rosy colour, absent from her face since the days of childhood, flushed once more into it by her\n",
      "sickness nigh unto death. She lay on the affected side, and with her other arm she was constantly\n",
      "sawing the air, not exactly in a restless manner, but in a monotonous, incessant way, very trying to\n",
      "a watcher. She was talking away, too, almost as constantly, in a low, indistinct tone. But her face,\n",
      "her profiled countenance, looked calm and smiling, even interested by the ideas that were passing\n",
      "through her clouded mind.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Listen!\" said Margaret, as she stooped her head down to catch the muttered words more\n",
      "distinctly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What will mother say? The bees are turning homeward for th' last time, and we've a terrible long\n",
      "bit to go yet. See! here's a linnet's nest in this gorse-bush. Th' hen-bird is on it. Look at her\n",

      "other; that they knew how in this illness to the old, world-weary woman, God had sent her a veiled\n",
      "blessing: she was once more in the scenes of her childhood, unchanged and bright as in those long\n",
      "departed days; once more with the sister of her youth, the playmate of fifty years ago, who had for\n",
      "nearly as many years slept in a grassy grave in the little church-yard beyond Burton.</p>\n",
      "<p>Alice's face changed; she looked sorrowful, almost penitent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Sally! I wish we'd told her. She thinks we were in church all morning, and we've gone on\n",
      "deceiving her. If we'd told her at first how it was—how sweet th' hawthorn smelt through the open\n",
      "church-door, and how we were on th' last bench in the aisle, and how it were the first butterfly\n",
      "we'd seen this spring, and how it flew into th' very church itself; oh! mother is so gentle, I wish\n",
      "we'd told her. I'll go to her next time she comes in sight, and say, 'Mother, we were naughty last\n",
      "Sabbath.'\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She stopped, and a few tears came stealing down the old withered cheek, at the thought of the\n",
      "temptation and deceit of her childhood. Surely, many sins could not have darkened that innocent\n",
      "child-like spirit since. Mary found a red-spotted pocket-handkerchief, and put it into the hand\n",
      "which sought about for something to wipe away the trickling tears. She took it with a gentle\n",
      "murmur.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thank you, mother.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary pulled Margaret away from the bed.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't you think she's happy, Margaret?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! that I do, bless her. She feels no pain, and knows nought of her present state. Oh! that I\n",
      "could see, Mary! I try and be patient with her afore me, but I'd give aught I have to see her, and\n",
      "see what she wants. I am so useless! I mean to stay here as long as Jane Wilson is alone; and I\n",
      "would fain be here all to-night, but—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll come,\" said Mary, decidedly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mrs. Davenport said she'd come again, but she's hard-worked all day—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll come,\" repeated Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Do!\" said Margaret, \"and I'll be here till you come. May be, Jem and you could take th' night\n",
      "between you, and Jane Wilson might get a bit of sound sleep in his bed; for she were up and down the\n",
      "better part of last night, and just when she were in a sound sleep this morning, between two and\n",
      "three, Jem came home, and th' sound o' his voice roused her in a minute.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where had he been till that time o' night?\" asked Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay! it were none of my business; and, indeed, I never saw him till he came in here to see\n",
      "Alice. He were in again this morning, and seemed sadly downcast. But you'll, may be, manage to\n",
      "comfort him to-night, Mary,\" said Margaret, smiling, while a ray of hope glimmered in Mary's heart,\n",
      "and she almost felt glad, for an instant, of the occasion which would at last bring them together.\n",
      "Oh! happy night! when would it come? Many hours had yet to pass.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then she saw Alice, and repented, with a bitter self-reproach. But she could not help having\n",
      "gladness in the depths of her heart, blame herself as she would. So she tried not to think, as she\n",
      "hurried along to Miss Simmonds', with a dancing step of lightness.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was late—that she knew she should be. Miss Simmonds was vexed and cross. That also she had\n",
      "anticipated, but she had intended to smooth her raven down by extraordinary diligence and attention.\n",
      "But there was something about the girls she did not understand—had not anticipated. They stopped\n",
      "talking when she came in; or rather, I should say, stopped listening, for Sally Leadbitter was the\n",
      "talker to whom they were hearkening with intense attention. At first they eyed Mary, as if she had\n",
      "acquired some new interest to them, since the day before. Then they began to whisper; and, absorbed\n",
      "as Mary had been in her own thoughts, she could not help becoming aware that it was of her they\n",
      "spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last Sally Leadbitter asked Mary if she had heard the news?</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! What news?\" answered she.</p>\n",
      "<p>The girls looked at each other with gloomy mystery. Sally went on.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Have you not heard that young Mr. Carson was murdered last night?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary's lips could not utter a negative, but no one who looked at her pale and terror-stricken\n",
      "face could have doubted that she had not heard before of the fearful occurrence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh, it is terrible, that sudden information, that one you have known has met with a bloody death!\n",
      "You seem to shrink from the world where such deeds can be committed, and to grow sick with the idea\n",
      "of the violent and wicked men of earth. Much as Mary had learned to dread him lately, now he was\n",
      "dead (and dead in such a manner) her feeling was that of oppressive sorrow for him.</p>\n",
      "<p>The room went round and round, and she felt as though she should faint; but Miss Simmonds came\n",
      "in, bringing a waft of fresher air as she opened the door, to refresh the body, and the certainty of\n",
      "a scolding for inattention to brace the sinking mind. She, too, was full of the morning's news.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Have you heard any more of this horrid affair, Miss Barton?\" asked she, as she settled to her\n",
      "work.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary tried to speak; at first she could not, and when she succeeded in uttering a sentence, it\n",
      "seemed as though it were not her own voice that spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, ma'am, I never heard of it till this minute.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear! that's strange, for every one is up about it. I hope the murderer will be found out, that\n",
      "I do. Such a handsome young man to be killed as he was. I hope the wretch that did it may be hanged\n",
      "as high as Haman.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>One of the girls reminded them that the assizes came on next week.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay,\" replied Miss Simmonds, \"and the milk-man told me they will catch the wretch, and have him\n",
      "tried and hung in less than a week. Serve him right, whoever he is. Such a handsome young man as he\n",
      "was.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Then each began to communicate to Miss Simmonds the various reports they had heard.</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly she burst out—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Miss Barton! as I live, dropping tears on that new silk gown of Mrs. Hawkes'! Don't you know\n",
      "they will stain, and make it shabby for ever? Crying like a baby, because a handsome young man meets\n",
      "with an untimely end. For shame of yourself, miss. Mind your character and your work if you please.\n",
      "Or, if you must cry\" (seeing her scolding rather increased the flow of Mary's tears, than\n",
      "otherwise), \"take this print to cry over. That won't be marked like this beautiful silk,\" rubbing\n",
      "it, as if she loved it, with a clean pocket-handkerchief, in order to soften the edges of the hard\n",
      "round drops.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary took the print, and naturally enough, having had leave given her to cry over it, rather\n",
      "checked the inclination to weep.</p>\n",
      "<p>Every body was full of the one subject. The girl sent out to match silk, came back with the\n",
      "account gathered at the shop, of the coroner's inquest then sitting; the ladies who called to speak\n",
      "about gowns first began about the murder, and mingled details of that, with directions for their\n",
      "dresses. Mary felt as though the haunting horror were a nightmare, a fearful dream, from which\n",
      "awakening would relieve her. The picture of the murdered body, far more ghastly than the reality,\n",
      "seemed to swim in the air before her eyes. Sally Leadbitter looked and spoke of her, almost\n",
      "accusingly, and made no secret now of Mary's conduct, more blameable to her fellow-workwomen for its\n",
      "latter changeableness, than for its former giddy flirting.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Poor young gentleman,\" said one, as Sally recounted Mary's last interview with Mr. Carson.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What a shame!\" exclaimed another, looking indignantly at Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's what I call regular jilting,\" said a third. \"And he lying cold and bloody in his coffin\n",
      "now!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary was more thankful than she could express, when Miss Simmonds returned, to put a stop to\n",
      "Sally's communications, and to check the remarks of the girls.</p>\n",
      "<p>She longed for the peace of Alice's sick room. No more thinking with infinite delight of her\n",
      "anticipated meeting with Jem, she felt too much shocked for that now; but longing for peace and\n",
      "kindness, for the images of rest and beauty, and sinless times long ago, which the poor old woman's\n",
      "rambling presented, she wished to be as near death as Alice; and to have struggled through this\n",
      "world, whose sufferings she had early learnt, and whose crimes now seemed pressing close upon her.\n",
      "Old texts from the Bible that her mother used to read (or rather spell out) aloud, in the days of\n",
      "childhood, came up to her memory. \"Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at\n",
      "rest.\" \"The tears shall be wiped away from all eyes,\" &amp;c. And it was to that world Alice was\n",
      "hastening! Oh! that she were Alice!</p>\n",
      "<p>I must return to the Wilsons' house, which was far from being the abode of peace that Mary was\n",
      "picturing it to herself. You remember the reward Mr. Carson offered for the apprehension of the\n",
      "murderer of his son? It was in itself a temptation, and to aid its efficacy came the natural\n",
      "sympathy for the aged parents mourning for their child, for the young man cut off in the flower of\n",
      "his days; and besides this, there is always a pleasure in unravelling a mystery, in catching at the\n",
      "gossamer clue which will guide to certainty. This feeling, I am sure, gives much impetus to the\n",
      "police. Their senses are ever and always on the qui-vive, and they enjoy the collecting and\n",
      "collating evidence, and the life of adventure they experience: a continual unwinding of Jack\n",
      "Sheppard romances, always interesting to the vulgar and uneducated mind, to which the outward signs\n",
      "and tokens of crime are ever exciting.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was no lack of clue or evidence at the coroner's inquest that morning. The shot, the\n",
      "finding of the body, the subsequent discovery of the gun, were rapidly deposed to; and then the\n",
      "policeman who had interrupted the quarrel between Jem Wilson and the murdered young man was brought\n",
      "forward, and gave his evidence, clear, simple, and straightforward. The coroner had no hesitation,\n",
      "the jury had none, but the verdict was cautiously worded. \"Wilful murder against some person\n",
      "unknown.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>This very cautiousness, when he deemed the thing so sure as to require no caution, irritated Mr.\n",
      "Carson. It did not soothe him that the superintendent called the verdict a mere form,—exhibited a\n",
      "warrant empowering him to seize the body of Jem Wilson, committed on suspicion,—declared his\n",
      "intention of employing a well-known officer in the Detective Service to ascertain the ownership of\n",
      "the gun, and to collect other evidence, especially as regarded the young woman, about whom the\n",
      "policeman deposed that the quarrel had taken place: Mr. Carson was still excited and irritable;\n",
      "restless in body and mind. He made every preparation for the accusation of Jem the following morning\n",
      "before the magistrates: he engaged attorneys skilled in criminal practice to watch the case and\n",
      "prepare briefs; he wrote to celebrated barristers coming the Northern Circuit, to bespeak their\n",
      "services. A speedy conviction, a speedy execution, seemed to be the only things that would satisfy\n",
      "his craving thirst for blood. He would have fain been policeman, magistrate, accusing speaker, all;\n",
      "but most of all, the judge, rising with full sentence of death on his lips.</p>\n",
      "<p>That afternoon, as Jane Wilson had begun to feel the effect of a night's disturbed rest, evinced\n",
      "in frequent droppings off to sleep while she sat by her sister-in-law's bed-side, lulled by the\n",
      "incessant crooning of the invalid's feeble voice, she was startled by a man speaking in the\n",
      "house-place below, who, wearied of knocking at the door, without obtaining any answer, had entered\n",
      "and was calling lustily for</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Missis! missis!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>When Mrs. Wilson caught a glimpse of the intruder through the stair-rails, she at once saw he was\n",
      "a stranger, a working-man, it might be a fellow-labourer with her son, for his dress was grimy\n",
      "enough for the supposition. He held a gun in his hand.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"May I make bold to ask if this gun belongs to your son?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She first looked at the man, and then, weary and half asleep, not seeing any reason for refusing\n",
      "to answer the inquiry, she moved forward to examine it, talking while she looked for certain\n",
      "old-fashioned ornaments on the stock. \"It looks like his; ay, it's his, sure enough. I could speak\n",
      "to it anywhere by these marks. You see it were his grandfather's, as were gamekeeper to some one up\n",
      "in th' north; and they don't make guns so smart now-a-days. But, how comed you by it? He sets great\n",
      "store on it. Is he bound for th' shooting gallery? He is not, for sure, now his aunt is so ill, and\n",
      "me left all alone;\" and the immediate cause for her anxiety being thus recalled to her mind, she\n",
      "entered on a long story of Alice's illness, interspersed with recollections of her husband's and her\n",
      "children's deaths.</p>\n",
      "<p>The disguised policeman listened for a minute or two, to glean any further information he could;\n",
      "and then, saying he was in a hurry, he turned to go away. She followed him to the door, still\n",
      "telling him her troubles, and was never struck, until it was too late to ask the reason, with the\n",
      "unaccountableness of his conduct, in carrying the gun away with him. Then, as she heavily climbed\n",
      "the stairs, she put away the wonder and the thought about his conduct, by determining to believe he\n",
      "was some workman with whom her son had made some arrangement about shooting at the gallery; or\n",
      "mending the old weapon; or something or other. She had enough to fret her, without moidering herself\n",
      "about old guns. Jem had given it him to bring to her; so it was safe enough; or, if it was not, why\n",
      "she should be glad never to set eyes on it again, for she could not abide fire-arms, they were so\n",
      "apt to shoot people.</p>\n",
      "<p>So, comforting herself for her want of thought in not making further inquiry, she fell off into\n",
      "another doze, feverish, dream-haunted, and unrefreshing.</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, the policeman walked off with his prize, with an odd mixture of feelings; a little\n",
      "contempt, a little disappointment, and a good deal of pity. The contempt and the disappointment were\n",
      "caused by the widow's easy admission of the gun being her son's property, and her manner of\n",
      "identifying it by the ornaments. He liked an attempt to baffle him; he was accustomed to it; it gave\n",
      "some exercise to his wits and his shrewdness. There would be no fun in fox-hunting, if Reynard\n",
      "yielded himself up without any effort to escape. Then, again, his mother's milk was yet in him,\n",
      "policeman, officer of the Detective Service though he was; and he felt sorry for the old woman,\n",
      "whose \"softness\" had given such material assistance in identifying her son as the murderer. However,\n",
      "he conveyed the gun, and the intelligence he had gained, to the superintendent; and the result was,\n",
      "that, in a short time afterwards, three policemen went to the works at which Jem was foreman, and\n",
      "announced their errand to the astonished overseer, who directed them to the part of the foundry\n",
      "where Jem was then superintending a casting.</p>\n",
      "<p>Dark, black were the walls, the ground, the faces around them, as they crossed the yard. But, in\n",
      "the furnace-house a deep and lurid red glared over all; the furnace roared with mighty flame. The\n",
      "men, like demons, in their fire-and-soot colouring, stood swart around, awaiting the moment when the\n",
      "tons of solid iron should have melted down into fiery liquid, fit to be poured, with still, heavy\n",
      "sound, into the delicate moulding of fine black sand, prepared to receive it. The heat was intense,\n",
      "and the red glare grew every instant more fierce; the policemen stood awed with the novel sight.\n",
      "Then, black figures, holding strange-shaped bucket shovels, came athwart the deep-red furnace light,\n",
      "and clear and brilliant flowed forth the iron into the appropriate mould. The buzz of voices rose\n",
      "again; there was time to speak, and gasp, and wipe the brows; and then, one by one, the men\n",
      "dispersed to some other branch of their employment.</p>\n",
      "<p>No. B. 72 pointed out Jem as the man he had seen engaged in a scuffle with Mr. Carson, and then\n",
      "the other two stepped forward and arrested him, stating of what he was accused, and the grounds of\n",
      "the accusation. He offered no resistance, though he seemed surprised; but calling a fellow-workman\n",
      "to him, he briefly requested him to tell his mother he had got into trouble, and could not return\n",
      "home at present. He did not wish her to hear more at first.</p>\n",
      "<p>So Mrs. Wilson's sleep was next interrupted in almost an exactly similar way to the last, like a\n",
      "recurring nightmare.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Missis! missis!\" some one called out from below.</p>\n",
      "<p>Again it was a workman, but this time a blacker-looking one than before.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What don ye want?\" said she, peevishly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Only nothing but—\" stammered the man, a kind-hearted matter-of-fact person, with no invention,\n",
      "but a great deal of sympathy.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well! speak out, can't ye, and ha' done with it?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem's in trouble,\" said he, repeating Jem's very words, as he could think of no others.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Trouble!\" said the mother, in a high-pitched voice of distress. \"Trouble! God help me, trouble\n",
      "will never end, I think. What d'ye mean by trouble? Speak out, man, can't ye? Is he ill? My boy!\n",
      "tell me, is he ill?\" in a hurried voice of terror.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Na, na, that's not it. He's well enough. All he bade me say was, 'Tell mother I'm in trouble,\n",
      "and can't come home to-night.'\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not come home to-night! And what am I to do with Alice? I can't go on, wearing my life out wi'\n",
      "watching. He might come and help me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I tell you he can't,\" said the man.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Can't; and he is well, you say? Stuff! It's just that he's getten like other young men, and\n",
      "wants to go a-larking. But I'll give it him when he comes back.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The man turned to go; he durst not trust himself to speak in Jem's justification. But she would\n",
      "not let him off.</p>\n",
      "<p>She stood between him and the door, as she said, \"Yo shall not go, till yo've told me what he's\n",
      "after. I can see plain enough you know, and I'll know too, before I've done.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You'll know soon enough, missis!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll know now, I tell ye. What's up that he can't come home and help me nurse? Me, as never got\n",
      "a wink o' sleep last night wi' watching.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, if you will have it out,\" said the poor badgered man, \"the police have got hold on\n",
      "him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"On my Jem!\" said the enraged mother. \"You're a downright liar, and that's what you are. My Jem,\n",
      "as never did harm to any one in his life. You're a liar, that's what you are.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He's done harm enough now,\" said the man, angry in his turn, \"for there's good evidence he\n",
      "murdered young Carson, as was shot last night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She staggered forward to strike the man for telling the terrible truth; but the weakness of old\n",
      "age, of motherly agony, overcame her, and she sank down on a chair, and covered her face. He could\n",
      "not leave her.</p>\n",
      "<p>When next she spoke, it was in an imploring, feeble, child-like voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, master, say you're only joking. I ax your pardon if I have vexed ye, but please say you're\n",
      "only joking. You don't know what Jem is to me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She looked humbly, anxiously up at him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wish I were only joking, missis; but it's true as I say. They've taken him up on charge o'\n",
      "murder. It were his gun as were found near th' place; and one o' the police heard him quarrelling\n",
      "with Mr. Carson a few days back, about a girl.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"About a girl!\" broke in the mother, once more indignant, though too feeble to show it as before.\n",
      "\"My Jem was as steady as—\" she hesitated for a comparison wherewith to finish, and then repeated,\n",
      "\"as steady as Lucifer, and he were an angel, you know. My Jem was not one to quarrel about a\n",
      "girl.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, but it was that, though. They'd got her name quite pat. The man had heard all they said.\n",
      "Mary Barton was her name, whoever she may be.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary Barton! the dirty hussey! to bring my Jem into trouble of this kind. I'll give it her well\n",
      "when I see her: that I will. Oh! my poor Jem!\" rocking herself to and fro. \"And what about the gun?\n",
      "What did ye say about that?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"His gun were found on th' spot where the murder were done.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's a lie for one, then. A man has got the gun now, safe and sound; I saw it not an hour\n",
      "ago.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The man shook his head.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, he has indeed. A friend o' Jem's, as he'd lent it to.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Did you know the chap?\" asked the man, who was really anxious for Jem's exculpation, and caught\n",
      "a gleam of hope from her last speech.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! I can't say as I did. But he were put on as a workman.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's may be only one of them policemen, disguised.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay; they'd never go for to do that, and trick me into telling on my own son. It would be like\n",
      "seething a kid in its mother's milk; and that th' Bible forbids.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't know,\" replied the man.</p>\n",
      "<p>Soon afterwards he went away, feeling unable to comfort, yet distressed at the sight of sorrow;\n",
      "she would fain have detained him, but go he would. And she was alone.</p>\n",
      "<p>She never for an instant believed Jem guilty; she would have doubted if the sun were fire, first:\n",
      "but sorrow, desolation, and, at times, anger took possession of her mind. She told the unconscious\n",

      "for to kill any man, choose how a girl had jilted him. My own good Jem, as was a blessing sent upon\n",

      "days when she had rocked the cradle of her \"first-born;\" and then, rapidly passing over events, till\n",
      "the full consciousness of his present situation came upon her, and perhaps annoyed at having shown\n",
      "any softness of character in the presence of the Dalilah who had lured him to his danger, she spoke\n",
      "again, and in a sharper tone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I told him, and told him to leave off thinking on thee; but he wouldn't be led by me. Thee!\n",

      "<p>But her last humble, self-abased words had touched Mrs. Wilson's heart, sore as it was; and she\n",
      "looked at the snow-pale girl with those piteous eyes, so hopeless of comfort, and she relented in\n",
      "spite of herself.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou seest what comes of light conduct, Mary! It's thy doing that suspicion has lighted on him,\n",

      "<p>Harsh as these words seem, she spoke them in a milder tone of voice than she had yet used. But\n",
      "the idea of Jem on the gallows, Jem dead, took possession of Mary, and she covered her eyes with her\n",
      "wan hands, as if indeed to shut out the fearful sight.</p>\n",
      "<p>She murmured some words, which, though spoken low, as if choked up from the depths of agony, Jane\n",
      "Wilson caught. \"My heart is breaking,\" said she, feebly. \"My heart is breaking.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nonsense!\" said Mrs. Wilson. \"Don't talk in that silly way. My heart has a better right to break\n",
      "than yours, and yet I hold up, you see. But, oh dear! oh dear!\" with a sudden revulsion of feeling,\n",
      "as the reality of the danger in which her son was placed pressed upon her. \"What am I saying? How\n",
      "could I hold up if thou wert gone, Jem? Though I'm as sure as I stand here of thy innocence, if they\n",
      "hang thee, my lad, I will lie down and die!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She sobbed aloud with bitter consciousness of the fearful chance awaiting her child. She cried\n",
      "more passionately still.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary roused herself up.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, let me stay with you, at any rate, till we know the end. Dearest Mrs. Wilson, mayn't I\n",
      "stay?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The more obstinately and upbraidingly Mrs. Wilson refused, the more Mary pleaded, with ever the\n",
      "same soft, entreating cry, \"Let me stay with you.\" Her stunned soul seemed to bound its wishes, for\n",
      "the hour at least, to remaining with one who loved and sorrowed for the same human being that she\n",
      "did.</p>\n",
      "<p>But no. Mrs. Wilson was inflexible.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I've may be been a bit hard on you, Mary, I'll own that. But I cannot abide you yet with me. I\n",
      "cannot but remember it's your giddiness as has wrought this woe. I'll stay wi' Alice, and perhaps\n",
      "Mrs. Davenport may come help a bit. I cannot put up with you about me. Good-night. To-morrow I may\n",
      "look on you different, may be. Good-night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And Mary turned out of the house, which had been <hi>his</hi> home, where <hi>he</hi> was loved,\n",
      "and mourned for, into the busy, desolate, crowded street, where they were crying halfpenny\n",
      "broadsides, giving an account of the bloody murder, the coroner's inquest, and a\n",
      "raw-head-and-bloody-bones picture of the suspected murderer, James Wilson.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Mary heard not, she heeded not. She staggered on like one in a dream. With hung head and\n",
      "tottering steps, she instinctively chose the shortest cut to that home, which was to her, in her\n",
      "present state of mind, only the hiding place of four walls, where she might vent her agony, unseen\n",
      "and unnoticed by the keen, unkind world without, but where no welcome, no love, no sympathising\n",
      "tears awaited her.</p>\n",
      "<p>As she neared that home, within two minutes' walk of it, her impetuous course was arrested by a\n",
      "light touch on her arm, and turning hastily, she saw a little Italian boy with his humble\n",
      "show-box,—a white mouse, or some such thing. The setting sun cast its red glow on his face,\n",
      "otherwise the olive complexion would have been very pale; and the glittering tear-drops hung on the\n",
      "long curled eye-lashes. With his soft voice and pleading looks, he uttered, in his pretty broken\n",
      "English, the words</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Hungry! so hungry.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And, as if to aid by gesture the effect of the solitary word, he pointed to his mouth, with its\n",
      "white quivering lips.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary answered him impatiently,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, lad, hunger is nothing—nothing!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And she rapidly passed on. But her heart upbraided her the next minute with her unrelenting\n",
      "speech, and she hastily entered her door and seized the scanty remnant of food which the cupboard\n",
      "contained, and retraced her steps to the place where the little hopeless stranger had sunk down by\n",
      "his mute companion in loneliness and starvation, and was raining down tears as he spoke in some\n",
      "foreign tongue, with low cries for the far distant \"Mamma mia!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>With the elasticity of heart belonging to childhood he sprang up as he saw the food the girl\n",
      "brought; she whose face, lovely in its woe, had tempted him first to address her; and, with the\n",
      "graceful courtesy of his country, he looked up and smiled while he kissed her hand, and then poured\n",
      "forth his thanks, and shared her bounty with his little pet companion. She stood an instant,\n",
      "diverted from the thought of her own grief by the sight of his infantine gladness; and then bending\n",
      "down and kissing his smooth forehead, she left him, and sought to be alone with her agony once\n",
      "more.</p>\n",
      "<p>She re-entered the house, locked the door, and tore off her bonnet, as if greedy of every moment\n",
      "which took her from the full indulgence of painful, despairing thought.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then she threw herself on the ground, yes, on the hard flags she threw her soft limbs down; and\n",
      "the comb fell out of her hair, and those bright tresses swept the dusty floor, while she pillowed\n",
      "and hid her face on her arms, and burst forth into hard, suffocating sobs.</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh, earth! thou didst seem but a dreary dwelling-place for thy poor child that night. None to\n",
      "comfort, none to pity! And self-reproach gnawing at her heart.</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh, why did she ever listen to the tempter? Why did she ever give ear to her own suggestions, and\n",
      "cravings after wealth and grandeur? Why had she thought it a fine thing to have a rich lover?</p>\n",
      "<p>She—she had deserved it all; but he was the victim,—he, the beloved. She could not conjecture,\n",
      "she could not even pause to think who had revealed, or how he had discovered her acquaintance with\n",
      "Harry Carson. It was but too clear, some way or another, he had learnt all; and what would he think\n",
      "of her? No hope of his love,—oh, that she would give up, and be content; it was his life, his\n",
      "precious life, that was threatened. Then she tried to recall the particulars, which, when Mrs.\n",
      "Wilson had given them, had fallen but upon a deafened ear,—something about a gun, a quarrel, which\n",
      "she could not remember clearly. Oh, how terrible to think of his crime, his blood-guiltiness; he who\n",
      "had hitherto been so good, so noble, and now an assassin! And then she shrank from him in thought;\n",
      "and then, with bitter remorse, clung more closely to his image with passionate self-upbraiding. Was\n",
      "it not she who had led him to the pit into which he had fallen? Was she to blame him? She to judge\n",
      "him? Who could tell how maddened he might have been by jealousy; how one moment's uncontrollable\n",
      "passion might have led him to become a murderer? And she had blamed him in her heart after his last\n",
      "deprecating, imploring, prophetic speech!</p>\n",
      "<p>Then she burst out crying afresh; and when weary of crying, fell to thinking again. The gallows!\n",
      "The gallows! Black it stood against the burning light which dazzled her shut eyes, press on them as\n",
      "she would. Oh! she was going mad; and for awhile she lay outwardly still, but with the pulses\n",
      "careering through her head with wild vehemence.</p>\n",
      "<p>And then came a strange forgetfulness of the present, in thought of the long-past times;—of those\n",
      "days when she hid her face on her mother's pitying, loving bosom, and heard tender words of comfort,\n",
      "be her grief or her error what it might;—of those days when she had felt as if her mother's love was\n",
      "too mighty not to last for ever;—of those days when hunger had been to her (as to the little\n",
      "stranger she had that evening relieved) something to be thought about, and mourned over;—when Jem\n",
      "and she had played together; he, with the condescension of an older child, and she, with unconscious\n",
      "earnestness, believing that he was as much gratified with important trifles as she was;—when her\n",
      "father was a cheery-hearted man, rich in the love of his wife, and the companionship of his\n",
      "friend;—when (for it still worked round to that), when mother was alive, and <hi>he</hi> was not a\n",
      "murderer.</p>\n",
      "<p>And then Heaven blessed her unaware, and she sank from remembering, to wandering, unconnected\n",
      "thought, and thence to sleep. Yes! it was sleep, though in that strange posture, on that hard cold\n",
      "bed; and she dreamt of the happy times of long ago, and her mother came to her, and kissed her as\n",

      "the gladness of childhood, even to the little kitten which had been her playmate and bosom friend\n",
      "then, and which had been long forgotten in her waking hours. All the loved ones were there!</p>\n",
      "<p>She suddenly wakened! Clear and wide awake! Some noise had startled her from sleep. She sat up,\n",
      "and put her hair (still wet with tears) back from her flushed cheeks, and listened. At first she\n",
      "could only hear her beating heart. All was still without, for it was after midnight, such hours of\n",
      "agony had passed away; but the moon shone clearly in at the unshuttered window, making the room\n",
      "almost as light as day, in its cold ghastly radiance. There was a low knock at the door! A strange\n",
      "feeling crept over Mary's heart, as if something spiritual were near; as if the dead, so lately\n",
      "present in her dreams, were yet gliding and hovering round her, with their dim, dread forms. And\n",
      "yet, why dread? Had they not loved her?—and who loved her now? Was she not lonely enough to welcome\n",
      "the spirits of the dead, who had loved her while here? If her mother had conscious being, her love\n",
      "for her child endured. So she quieted her fears, and listened—listened still.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary! Mary! open the door!\" as a little movement on her part seemed to tell the being outside of\n",
      "her wakeful, watchful state. They were the accents of her mother's voice; the very south-country\n",
      "pronunciation, that Mary so well remembered; and which she had sometimes tried to imitate when\n",
      "alone, with the fond mimicry of affection.</p>\n",
      "<p>So, without fear, without hesitation, she rose and unbarred the door. There, against the\n",
      "moonlight, stood a form, so closely resembling her dead mother, that Mary never doubted the\n",
      "identity, but exclaiming (as if she were a terrified child, secure of safety when near the\n",
      "protecting care of its parent)—</p>\n",

      "<p>The murder had been committed early on Thursday night, and between then and the dawn of the\n",
      "following day there was ample time for the news to spread far and wide among all those whose duty,\n",
      "or whose want, or whose errors, caused them to be abroad in the streets of Manchester.</p>\n",
      "<p>Among those who listened to the tale of violence was Esther.</p>\n",
      "<p>A craving desire to know more took possession of her mind. Far away as she was from Turner\n",
      "Street, she immediately set off to the scene of the murder, which was faintly lighted by the gray\n",
      "dawn as she reached the spot. It was so quiet and still that she could hardly believe it to be the\n",
      "place. The only vestige of any scuffle or violence was a trail on the dust, as if somebody had been\n",
      "lying there, and then been raised by extraneous force. The little birds were beginning to hop and\n",
      "twitter in the leafless hedge, making the only sound that was near and distinct. She crossed into\n",
      "the field where she guessed the murderer to have stood; it was easy of access, for the worn, stunted\n",
      "hawthorn-hedge had many gaps in it. The night-smell of bruised grass came up from under her feet, as\n",
      "she went towards the saw-pit and carpenter's shed, which, as I have said before, were in a corner of\n",
      "the field near the road, and where one of her informants had told her it was supposed by the police\n",
      "that the murderer had lurked while waiting for his victim. There was no sign, however, that any one\n",
      "had been about the place. If the grass had been bruised or bent where he had trod, it had had enough\n",
      "of the elasticity of life to raise itself under the dewy influences of night. She hushed her breath\n",
      "with involuntary awe, but nothing else told of the violent deed by which a fellow-creature had\n",
      "passed away. She stood still for a minute, imagining to herself the position of the parties, guided\n",
      "by the only circumstance which afforded any evidence, the trailing mark on the dust in the road.</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly (it was before the sun had risen above the horizon) she became aware of something white\n",
      "in the hedge. All other colours wore the same murky hue, though the forms of objects were perfectly\n",
      "distinct. What was it? It could not be a flower;—that, the time of year made clear. A frozen lump of\n",
      "snow, lingering late in one of the gnarled tufts of the hedge? She stepped forward to examine. It\n",
      "proved to be a little piece of stiff writing-paper compressed into a round shape. She understood it\n",
      "instantly; it was the paper that had served as wadding for the murderer's gun. Then she had been\n",
      "standing just where the murderer must have been but a few hours before; probably (as the rumour had\n",
      "spread through the town, reaching her ears) one of the poor maddened turn-outs, who hung about\n",
      "everywhere, with black, fierce looks, as if contemplating some deed of violence. Her sympathy was\n",
      "all with them, for she had known what they suffered; and besides this there was her own individual\n",
      "dislike of Mr. Carson, and dread of him for Mary's sake. Yet, poor Mary! Death was a terrible,\n",
      "though sure, remedy for the evil Esther had dreaded for her; and how would she stand the shock,\n",
      "loving as her aunt believed her to do? Poor Mary! who would comfort her? Esther's thoughts began to\n",
      "picture her sorrow, her despair, when the news of her lover's death should reach her; and she longed\n",
      "to tell her there might have been a keener grief yet had he lived.</p>\n",
      "<p>Bright, beautiful came the slanting rays of the morning sun. It was time for such as she to hide\n",
      "themselves, with the other obscene things of night, from the glorious light of day, which was only\n",
      "for the happy. So she turned her steps towards town, still holding the paper. But in getting over\n",
      "the hedge it encumbered her to hold it in her clasped hand, and she threw it down. She passed on a\n",
      "few steps, her thoughts still of Mary, till the idea crossed her mind, could it (blank as it\n",
      "appeared to be) give any clue to the murderer? As I said before, her sympathies were all on that\n",
      "side, so she turned back and picked it up; and then feeling as if in some measure an accessory, she\n",
      "hid it unexamined in her hand, and hastily passed out of the street at the opposite end to that by\n",
      "which she had entered it.</p>\n",
      "<p>And what do you think she felt, when, having walked some distance from the spot, she dared to\n",
      "open the crushed paper, and saw written on it Mary Barton's name, and not only that, but the street\n",
      "in which she lived! True, a letter or two was torn off, but, nevertheless, there was the name clear\n",
      "to be recognised. And oh! what terrible thought flashed into her mind; or was it only fancy? But it\n",
      "looked very like the writing which she had once known well—the writing of Jem Wilson, who, when she\n",
      "lived at her brother-in-law's, and he was a near neighbour, had often been employed by her to write\n",
      "her letters to people, to whom she was ashamed of sending her own misspelt scrawl. She remembered\n",
      "the wonderful flourishes she had so much admired in those days, while she sat by dictating, and Jem,\n",
      "in all the pride of newly-acquired penmanship, used to dazzle her eyes by extraordinary graces and\n",
      "twirls.</p>\n",
      "<p>If it were his!</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh! perhaps it was merely that her head was running so on Mary, that she was associating every\n",
      "trifle with her. As if only one person wrote in that flourishing, meandering style!</p>\n",
      "<p>It was enough to fill her mind to think from what she might have saved Mary by securing the\n",
      "paper. She would look at it just once more, and see if some very dense and stupid policeman could\n",
      "have mistaken the name, or if Mary would certainly have been dragged into notice in the affair.</p>\n",
      "<p>No! no one could have mistaken the \"ry Barton,\" and it <hi>was</hi> Jem's handwriting!</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh! if it was so, she understood it all, and she had been the cause! With her violent and\n",
      "unregulated nature, rendered morbid by the course of life she led, and her consciousness of her\n",
      "degradation, she cursed herself for the interference which she believed had led to this; for the\n",
      "information and the warning she had given to Jem, which had roused him to this murderous action. How\n",
      "could she, the abandoned and polluted outcast, ever have dared to hope for a blessing, even on her\n",
      "efforts to do good? The black curse of Heaven rested on all her doings, were they for good or for\n",
      "evil.</p>\n",
      "<p>Poor, diseased mind! and there were none to minister to thee!</p>\n",
      "<p>So she wandered about, too restless to take her usual heavy morning's sleep, up and down the\n",
      "streets, greedily listening to every word of the passers by, and loitering near each group of\n",
      "talkers, anxious to scrape together every morsel of information, or conjecture, or suspicion, though\n",
      "without possessing any definite purpose in all this. And ever and always she clenched the scrap of\n",
      "paper which might betray so much, until her nails had deeply indented the palm of her hand; so\n",
      "fearful was she in her nervous dread, lest unawares she should let it drop.</p>\n",
      "<p>Towards the middle of the day she could no longer evade the body's craving want of rest and\n",
      "refreshment; but the rest was taken in a spirit vault, and the refreshment was a glass of gin.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then she started up from the stupor she had taken for repose; and suddenly driven before the\n",
      "gusty impulses of her mind, she pushed her way to the place where at that very time the police were\n",
      "bringing the information they had gathered with regard to the all-engrossing murder. She listened\n",
      "with painful acuteness of comprehension to dropped words and unconnected sentences, the meaning of\n",
      "which became clearer, and yet more clear to her. Jem was suspected. Jem was ascertained to be the\n",
      "murderer.</p>\n",
      "<p>She saw him (although he, absorbed in deep sad thought, saw her not), she saw him brought\n",
      "hand-cuffed and guarded out of the coach. She saw him enter the station,—she gasped for breath till\n",
      "he came out, still hand-cuffed, and still guarded, to be conveyed to the New Bailey.</p>\n",
      "<p>He was the only one who had spoken to her with hope, that she might yet win her way back to\n",
      "virtue. His words had lingered in her heart with a sort of call to Heaven, like distant Sabbath\n",
      "bells, although in her despair she had turned away from his voice. He was the only one who had\n",
      "spoken to her kindly. The murder, shocking though it was, was an absent, abstract thing, on which\n",
      "her thoughts could not, and would not dwell; all that was present in her mind was Jem's danger, and\n",
      "his kindness.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then Mary came to remembrance. Esther wondered till she was sick of wondering, in what way she\n",
      "was taking the affair. In some manner it would be a terrible blow for the poor, motherless girl;\n",
      "with her dreadful father, too, who was to Esther a sort of accusing angel.</p>\n",
      "<p>She set off towards the court where Mary lived, to pick up what she could there of information.\n",
      "But she was ashamed to enter in where once she had been innocent, and hung about the neighbouring\n",
      "streets, not daring to question, so she learnt but little; nothing in fact but the knowledge of John\n",
      "Barton's absence from home.</p>\n",
      "<p>She went up a dark entry to rest her weary limbs on a door-step and think. Her elbows on her\n",
      "knees, her face hidden in her hands, she tried to gather together and arrange her thoughts. But\n",
      "still every now and then she opened her hand to see if the paper were yet there.</p>\n",
      "<p>She got up at last. She had formed a plan, and had a course of action to look forward to that\n",
      "would satisfy one craving desire at least. The time was long gone by when there was much wisdom or\n",
      "consistency in her projects.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was getting late, and that was so much the better. She went to a pawn-shop, and took off her\n",
      "finery in a back room. She was known by the people, and had a character for honesty, so she had no\n",
      "very great difficulty in inducing them to let her have a suit of outer clothes, befitting the wife\n",
      "of a working-man, a black silk bonnet, a printed gown, a plaid shawl, dirty and rather worn to be\n",
      "sure, but which had a sort of sanctity to the eyes of the street-walker as being the appropriate\n",
      "garb of that happy class to which she could never, never more belong.</p>\n",
      "<p>She looked at herself in the little glass which hung against the wall, and sadly shaking her\n",
      "head, thought how easy were the duties of that Eden of innocence from which she was shut out; how\n",
      "she would work, and toil, and starve, and die, if necessary, for a husband, a home,—for\n",
      "children,—but that thought she could not bear; a little form rose up, stern in its innocence, from\n",
      "the witches' cauldron of her imagination, and she rushed into action again.</p>\n",
      "<p>You know now how she came to stand by the threshold of Mary's door, waiting, trembling, until the\n",
      "latch was lifted, and her niece, with words that spoke of such desolation among the living, fell\n",
      "into her arms.</p>\n",
      "<p>She had felt as if some holy spell would prevent her (even as the unholy Lady Geraldine was\n",
      "prevented, in the abode of Christabel) from crossing the threshold of that home of her early\n",
      "innocence; and she had meant to wait for an invitation. But Mary's helpless action did away with all\n",
      "reluctant feeling, and she bore or dragged her to a seat, and looked on her bewildered eyes, as,\n",
      "puzzled with the likeness, which was not identity, she gazed on her aunt's features.</p>\n",
      "<p>In pursuance of her plan, Esther meant to assume the manners and character, as she had done the\n",
      "dress, of a mechanic's wife; but then, to account for her long absence, and her long silence towards\n",
      "all that ought to have been dear to her, it was necessary that she should put on an indifference far\n",
      "distant from her heart, which was loving and yearning, in spite of all its faults. And, perhaps, she\n",
      "overacted her part, for certainly Mary felt a kind of repugnance to the changed and altered aunt,\n",
      "who so suddenly re-appeared on the scene; and it would have cut Esther to the very core, could she\n",
      "have known how her little darling of former days was feeling towards her.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You don't remember me I see, Mary!\" she began. \"It's a long while since I left you all, to be\n",
      "sure; and I, many a time, thought of coming to see you, and—and your father. But I live so far off,\n",
      "and am always so busy, I cannot do just what I wish. You recollect aunt Esther, don't you,\n",
      "Mary?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Are you aunt Hetty?\" asked Mary, faintly, still looking at the face which was so different from\n",
      "the old recollections of her aunt's fresh dazzling beauty.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes! I am aunt Hetty. Oh! it's so long since I heard that name,\" sighing forth the thoughts it\n",
      "suggested; then recovering herself, and striving after the hard character she wished to assume, she\n",
      "continued: \"And to-day I heard a friend of yours, and of mine too, long ago, was in trouble, and I\n",
      "guessed you would be in sorrow, so I thought I would just step this far and see you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary's tears flowed afresh, but she had no desire to open her heart to her strangely-found aunt,\n",
      "who had, by her own confession, kept aloof from and neglected them for so many years. Yet she tried\n",
      "to feel grateful for kindness (however late) from any one, and wished to be civil. Moreover, she had\n",
      "a strong disinclination to speak on the terrible subject uppermost in her mind. So, after a pause\n",
      "she said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thank you. I dare say you mean very kind. Have you had a long walk? I'm so sorry,\" said she,\n",
      "rising, with a sudden thought, which was as suddenly checked by recollection, \"but I've nothing to\n",
      "eat in the house, and I'm sure you must be hungry, after your walk.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>For Mary concluded that certainly her aunt's residence must be far away on the other side of the\n",
      "town, out of sight or hearing. But, after all, she did not think much about her; her heart was so\n",
      "aching-full of other things, that all besides seemed like a dream. She received feelings and\n",
      "impressions from her conversation with her aunt, but did not, could not, put them together, or think\n",
      "or argue about them.</p>\n",
      "<p>And Esther! How scanty had been her food for days and weeks, her thinly-covered bones and pale\n",
      "lips might tell, but her words should never reveal! So, with a little unreal laugh, she replied,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! Mary, my dear! don't talk about eating. We've the best of every thing, and plenty of it, for\n",
      "my husband is in good work. I'd such a supper before I came out. I couldn't touch a morsel if you\n",
      "had it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Her words shot a strange pang through Mary's heart. She had always remembered her aunt's loving\n",
      "and unselfish disposition; how was it changed, if, living in plenty, she had never thought it worth\n",
      "while to ask after her relations, who were all but starving! She shut up her heart instinctively\n",
      "against her aunt.</p>\n",
      "<p>And all the time poor Esther was swallowing her sobs, and over-acting her part, and controlling\n",
      "herself more than she had done for many a long day, in order that her niece might not be shocked and\n",
      "revolted, by the knowledge of what her aunt had become:—a prostitute; an outcast.</p>\n",
      "<p>For she longed to open her wretched, wretched heart, so hopeless, so abandoned by all living\n",
      "things, to one who had loved her once; and yet she refrained, from dread of the averted eye, the\n",
      "altered voice, the internal loathing, which she feared such disclosure might create. She would go\n",
      "straight to the subject of the day. She could not tarry long, for she felt unable to support the\n",
      "character she had assumed for any length of time.</p>\n",
      "<p>They sat by the little round table, facing each other. The candle was placed right between them,\n",
      "and Esther moved it in order to have a clearer view of Mary's face, so that she might read her\n",
      "emotions, and ascertain her interests. Then she began:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's a bad business, I'm afraid, this of Mr. Carson's murder.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary winced a little.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I hear Jem Wilson is taken up for it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary covered her eyes with her hands, as if to shade them from the light, and Esther herself,\n",
      "less accustomed to self-command, was getting too much agitated for calm observation of another.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I was taking a walk near Turner Street, and I went to see the spot,\" continued Esther, \"and, as\n",
      "luck would have it, I spied this bit of paper in the hedge,\" producing the precious piece still\n",
      "folded in her hand. \"It has been used as wadding for the gun, I reckon; indeed, that's clear enough,\n",
      "from the shape it's crammed into. I was sorry for the murderer, whoever he might be (I didn't then\n",
      "know of Jem's being suspected), and I thought I would never leave a thing about as might help, if\n",
      "ever so little, to convict him; the police are so 'cute about straws. So I carried it a little way,\n",
      "and then I opened it and saw your name, Mary.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary took her hands away from her eyes, and looked with surprise at her aunt's face, as she\n",
      "uttered these words. She <hi>was</hi> kind after all, for was she not saving her from being\n",
      "summoned, and from being questioned and examined; a thing to be dreaded above all others: as she\n",
      "felt sure that her unwilling answers, frame them how she might, would add to the suspicions against\n",
      "Jem; her aunt was indeed kind, to think of what would spare her this.</p>\n",
      "<p>Esther went on, without noticing Mary's look. The very action of speaking was so painful to her,\n",
      "and so much interrupted by the hard, raking little cough, which had been her constant annoyance for\n",
      "months, that she was too much engrossed by the physical difficulty of utterance, to be a very close\n",
      "observer.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"There could be no mistake if they had found it. Look at your name, together with the very name\n",
      "of this court! And in Jem's hand-writing too, or I'm much mistaken. Look, Mary!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And now she did watch her.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary took the paper and flattened it; then suddenly stood stiff up, with irrepressible movement,\n",
      "as if petrified by some horror abruptly disclosed; her face, strung and rigid; her lips compressed\n",
      "tight, to keep down some rising exclamation. She dropped on her seat, as suddenly as if the braced\n",
      "muscles had in an instant given way. But she spoke no word.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It is his hand-writing—isn't it?\" asked Esther, though Mary's manner was almost confirmation\n",
      "enough.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You will not tell. You never will tell,\" demanded Mary, in a tone so sternly earnest, as almost\n",
      "to be threatening.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay, Mary,\" said Esther, rather reproachfully, \"I am not so bad as that. Oh! Mary, you cannot\n",
      "think I would do that, whatever I may be.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The tears sprang to her eyes at the idea that she was suspected of being one who would help to\n",
      "inform against an old friend.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary caught her sad and upbraiding look.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! I know you would not tell, aunt. I don't know what I say, I am so shocked. But say you will\n",
      "not tell. Do.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, indeed I will not tell, come what may.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary sat still, looking at the writing, and turning the paper round with careful examination,\n",
      "trying to hope, but her very fears belying her hopes.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I thought you cared for the young man that's murdered,\" observed Esther, half aloud; but feeling\n",
      "that she could not mistake this strange interest in the suspected murderer, implied by Mary's\n",
      "eagerness to screen him from any thing which might strengthen suspicion against him. She had come,\n",
      "desirous to know the extent of Mary's grief for Mr. Carson, and glad of the excuse afforded her by\n",
      "the important scrap of paper. Her remark about its being Jem's hand-writing, she had, with this view\n",
      "of ascertaining Mary's state of feeling, felt to be most imprudent the instant after she uttered it;\n",
      "but Mary's anxiety that she should not tell was too great, and too decided, to leave a doubt as to\n",
      "her interest for Jem. She grew more and more bewildered, and her dizzy head refused to reason. Mary\n",
      "never spoke. She held the bit of paper firmly, determined to retain possession of it, come what\n",
      "might; and anxious, and impatient, for her aunt to go. As she sat, her face bore a likeness to\n",
      "Esther's dead child.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You are so like my little girl, Mary!\" said Esther, weary of the one subject on which she could\n",
      "get no satisfaction, and recurring, with full heart, to the thought of the dead.</p>\n",

      "be. Her aunt had children, then; and she was on the point of putting some question about them, but\n",
      "before it could be spoken another thought turned it aside, and she went back to her task of\n",

      "in this longed-for, dreaded interview with Mary; she had wished to impose upon her with her tale of\n",
      "married respectability, and yet she had yearned and craved for sympathy in her real lot. And she had\n",
      "imposed upon her well. She should perhaps be glad of it afterwards; but her desolation of hope\n",
      "seemed for the time redoubled. And she must leave the old dwelling-place, whose very walls, and\n",
      "flags, dingy and sordid as they were, had a charm for her. Must leave the abode of poverty, for the\n",
      "more terrible abodes of vice. She must—she would go.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, good-night, Mary. That bit of paper is safe enough with you, I see. But you made me\n",
      "promise I would not tell about it, and you must promise me to destroy it before you sleep.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I promise,\" said Mary, hoarsely, but firmly. \"Then you are going?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes. Not if you wish me to stay. Not if I could be of any comfort to you, Mary;\" catching at\n",
      "some glimmering hope.</p>\n",

      "you must tell me all about yourself. I forget what your name is?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Fergusson,\" said Esther, sadly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mrs. Fergusson,\" repeated Mary, half unconsciously. \"And where did you say you lived?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I never did say,\" muttered Esther; then aloud, \"In Angel's Meadow, 145, Nicholas Street.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"145, Nicholas Street, Angel Meadow. I shall remember.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>As Esther drew her shawl around her, and prepared to depart, a thought crossed Mary's mind that\n",

      "bringing her the paper (that dread, terrible piece of paper) and thus saving her from—she could not\n",
      "rightly think how much, or how little she was spared. So, desirous of making up for her previous\n",
      "indifferent manner, she advanced to kiss her aunt before her departure.</p>\n",
      "<p>But, to her surprise, her aunt pushed her off with a frantic kind of gesture, and saying the\n",
      "words,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not me. You must never kiss me. You!\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Her father was the murderer!</p>\n",
      "<p>That corner of stiff, shining, thick writing-paper, she recognised as part of the sheet on which\n",
      "she had copied Samuel Bamford's beautiful lines so many months ago—copied (as you perhaps remember)\n",
      "on the blank part of a valentine sent to her by Jem Wilson, in those days when she did not treasure\n",
      "and hoard up every thing he had touched, as she would do now.</p>\n",
      "<p>That copy had been given to her father, for whom it was made, and she had occasionally seen him\n",
      "reading it over, not a fortnight ago she was sure. But she resolved to ascertain if the other part\n",
      "still remained in his possession. He might, it was just possible he <hi>might</hi>, have given it\n",
      "away to some friend; and if so, that person was the guilty one, for she could swear to the paper\n",
      "anywhere.</p>\n",
      "<p>First of all she pulled out every article from the little old chest of drawers. Amongst them were\n",
      "some things which had belonged to her mother, but she had no time now to examine and try and\n",
      "remember them. All the reverence she could pay them was to carry them and lay them on the bed\n",
      "carefully, while the other things were tossed impatiently out upon the floor.</p>\n",
      "<p>The copy of Bamford's lines was not there. Oh! perhaps he might have given it away; but then must\n",

      "<p>And she set to with redoubled vigour to examine the deal-box which served as chair, and which had\n",

      "clothes.</p>\n",
      "<p>He had redeemed his better coat from the pawn-shop before he left, that she had noticed. Here was\n",
      "his old one. What rustled under her hand in the pocket?</p>\n",
      "<p>The paper! \"Oh! Father!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Yes, it fitted; jagged end to jagged end, letter to letter; and even the part which Esther had\n",
      "considered blank had its tallying mark with the larger piece, its tails of <hi>y</hi>s and\n",
      "<hi>g</hi>s. And then, as if that were not damning evidence enough, she felt again, and found some\n",
      "bullets or shot (I don't know which you would call them) in that same pocket, along with a small\n",
      "paper parcel of gunpowder. As she was going to replace the jacket, having abstracted the paper, and\n",
      "bullets, &amp;c., she saw a woollen gun-case made of that sort of striped horse-cloth you must have\n",
      "seen a thousand times appropriated to such a purpose. The sight of it made her examine still\n",
      "further, but there was nothing else that could afford any evidence, so she locked the box, and sat\n",
      "down on the floor to contemplate the articles; now with a sickening despair, now with a kind of\n",
      "wondering curiosity, how her father had managed to evade observation. After all it was easy enough.\n",
      "He had evidently got possession of some gun (was it really Jem's; was he an accomplice? No! she did\n",
      "not believe it; he never, never would deliberately plan a murder with another, however he might be\n",

      "without previously warning her; it was out of his nature).</p>\n",
      "<p>Then having obtained possession of the gun, her father had loaded it at home, and might have\n",
      "carried it away with him some time when the neighbours were not noticing, and she was out, or\n",
      "asleep; and then he might have hidden it somewhere to be in readiness when he should want it. She\n",
      "was sure he had no such thing with him when he went away the last time.</p>\n",
      "<p>She felt it was of no use to conjecture his motives. His actions had become so wild and irregular\n",
      "of late, that she could not reason upon them. Besides, was it not enough to know that he was guilty\n",
      "of this terrible offence? Her love for her father seemed to return with painful force, mixed up as\n",
      "it was with horror at his crime. That dear father, who was once so kind, so warm-hearted, so ready\n",
      "to help either man or beast in distress, to murder! But, in the desert of misery with which these\n",
      "thoughts surrounded her, the arid depths of whose gloom she dared not venture to contemplate, a\n",
      "little spring of comfort was gushing up at her feet, unnoticed at first, but soon to give her\n",
      "strength and hope.</p>\n",
      "<p>And <hi>that</hi> was the necessity for exertion on her part which this discovery enforced.</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh! I do think that the necessity for exertion, for some kind of action (bodily or mental) in\n",
      "time of distress, is a most infinite blessing, although the first efforts at such seasons are\n",
      "painful. Something to be done implies that there is yet hope of some good thing to be accomplished,\n",
      "or some additional evil that may be avoided; and by degrees the hope absorbs much of the sorrow.</p>\n",
      "<p>It is the woes that cannot in any earthly way be escaped that admit least earthly comforting. Of\n",
      "all trite, worn-out, hollow mockeries of comfort that were ever uttered by people who will not take\n",
      "the trouble of sympathising with others, the one I dislike the most is the exhortation not to grieve\n",
      "over an event, \"for it cannot be helped.\" Do you think if I could help it, I would sit still with\n",
      "folded hands, content to mourn? Do you not believe that as long as hope remained I would be up and\n",
      "doing? I mourn because what has occurred cannot be helped. The reason you give me for not grieving,\n",
      "is the very and sole reason of my grief. Give me nobler and higher reasons for enduring meekly what\n",
      "my Father sees fit to send, and I will try earnestly and faithfully to be patient; but mock me not,\n",
      "or any other mourner, with the speech, \"Do not grieve, for it cannot be helped. It is past\n",
      "remedy.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But some remedy to Mary's sorrow came with thinking. If her father was guilty, Jem was innocent.\n",
      "If innocent, there was a possibility of saving him. He must be saved. And she must do it; for was\n",
      "not she the sole depository of the terrible secret? Her father was not suspected; and never should\n",
      "be, if by any foresight or any exertions of her own she could prevent it.</p>\n",
      "<p>She did not yet know how Jem was to be saved, while her father was also to be considered\n",
      "innocent. It would require much thought and much prudence. But with the call upon her exertions, and\n",
      "her various qualities of judgment and discretion, came the answering consciousness of innate power\n",
      "to meet the emergency. Every step now, nay, the employment of every minute, was of consequence; for\n",
      "you must remember she had learnt at Miss Simmonds' the probability that the murderer would be\n",
      "brought to trial the next week. And you must remember, too, that never was so young a girl so\n",
      "friendless, or so penniless, as Mary was at this time. But the lion accompanied Una through the\n",
      "wilderness and the danger; and so will a high, resolved purpose of right-doing ever guard and\n",
      "accompany the helpless.</p>\n",
      "<p>It struck two; deep, mirk, night.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was of no use bewildering herself with plans this weary, endless night. Nothing could be done\n",
      "before morning: and, at first in her impatience, she began to long for day; but then she felt in how\n",
      "unfit a state her body was for any plan of exertion, and she resolutely made up her mind to husband\n",
      "her physical strength.</p>\n",
      "<p>First of all she must burn the tell-tale paper. The powder, bullets, and gun-case, she tied into\n",
      "a bundle, and hid in the sacking of the bed for the present, although there was no likelihood of\n",
      "their affording evidence against any one. Then she carried the paper down stairs, and burnt it on\n",
      "the hearth, powdering the very ashes with her fingers, and dispersing the fragments of fluttering\n",
      "black films among the cinders of the grate. Then she breathed again.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her head ached with dizzying violence; she must get quit of the pain or it would incapacitate her\n",
      "for thinking and planning. She looked for food, but there was nothing but a little raw oatmeal in\n",
      "the house: still, although it almost choked her, she ate some of this, knowing from experience, how\n",
      "often headaches were caused by long fasting. Then she sought for some water to bathe her throbbing\n",
      "temples, and quench her feverish thirst. There was none in the house, so she took the jug and went\n",
      "out to the pump at the other end of the court, whose echoes resounded her light footsteps in the\n",
      "quiet stillness of the night. The hard, square outlines of the houses cut sharply against the cold\n",
      "bright sky, from which myriads of stars were shining down in eternal repose. There was little\n",
      "sympathy in the outward scene, with the internal trouble. All was so still, so motionless, so hard!\n",
      "Very different to this lovely night in the country in which I am now writing, where the distant\n",
      "horizon is soft and undulating in the moonlight, and the nearer trees sway gently to and fro in the\n",
      "night-wind with something of almost human motion; and the rustling air makes music among their\n",
      "branches, as if speaking soothingly to the weary ones who lie awake in heaviness of heart. The\n",
      "sights and sounds of such a night lull pain and grief to rest.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Mary re-entered her home after she had filled her pitcher, with a still stronger sense of\n",
      "anxiety, and a still clearer conviction of how much rested upon her unassisted and friendless self,\n",
      "alone with her terrible knowledge, in the hard, cold, populous world.</p>\n",
      "<p>She bathed her forehead, and quenched her thirst, and then, with wise deliberation of purpose,\n",
      "went upstairs, and undressed herself, as if for a long night's slumber, although so few hours\n",
      "intervened before day-dawn. She believed she never could sleep, but she lay down, and shut her eyes;\n",
      "and before many minutes she was in as deep and sound a slumber as if there was no sin nor sorrow in\n",
      "the world.</p>\n",
      "<p>She awakened, as it was natural, much refreshed in body; but with a consciousness of some great\n",
      "impending calamity. She sat up in bed to recollect, and when she did remember, she sank down again\n",
      "with all the helplessness of despair. But it was only the weakness of an instant; for were not the\n",
      "very minutes precious, for deliberation if not for action?</p>\n",
      "<p>Before she had finished the necessary morning business of dressing, and setting her house in some\n",
      "kind of order, she had disentangled her ravelled ideas, and arranged some kind of a plan for action.\n",
      "If Jem was innocent (and now, of his guilt, even his slightest participation in, or knowledge of,\n",
      "the murder, she acquitted him with all her heart and soul), he must have been somewhere else when\n",
      "the crime was committed; probably with some others, who might bear witness to the fact, if she only\n",
      "knew where to find them. Every thing rested on her. She had heard of an alibi, and believed it might\n",
      "mean the deliverance she wished to accomplish; but she was not quite sure, and determined to apply\n",
      "to Job, as one of the few among her acquaintance gifted with the knowledge of hard words, for to\n",
      "her, all terms of law, or natural history, were alike many-syllabled mysteries.</p>\n",
      "<p>No time was to be lost. She went straight to Job Legh's house, and found the old man and his\n",
      "grand-daughter sitting at breakfast; as she opened the door she heard their voices speaking in a\n",
      "grave, hushed, subdued tone, as if something grieved their hearts. They stopped talking on her\n",
      "entrance, and then she knew they had been conversing about the murder; about Jem's probable guilt;\n",
      "and (it flashed upon her for the first time) on the new light they would have obtained regarding\n",
      "herself: for until now they had never heard of her giddy flirting with Mr. Carson; not in all her\n",
      "confidential talk with Margaret had she ever spoken of him. And now Margaret would hear her conduct\n",
      "talked of by all, as that of a bold, bad girl; and even if she did not believe every thing that was\n",
      "said, she could hardly help feeling wounded, and disappointed in Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>So it was in a timid voice that Mary wished her usual good-morrow, and her heart sank within her\n",
      "a little, when Job, with a form of civility, bade her welcome in that dwelling, where, until now,\n",
      "she had been too well assured to require to be asked to sit down.</p>\n",
      "<p>She took a chair. Margaret continued silent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm come to speak to you about this—about Jem Wilson.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's a bad business, I'm afeared,\" replied Job, sadly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, it's bad enough anyhow. But Jem's innocent. Indeed he is; I'm as sure as sure can be.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How can you know, wench? Facts bear strong again him, poor fellow, though he'd a deal to put him\n",
      "up, and aggravate him, they say. Ay, poor lad, he's done for himself, I'm afeared.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Job!\" said Mary, rising from her chair in her eagerness, \"you must not say he did it. He didn't;\n",
      "I'm sure and certain he didn't. Oh! why do you shake your head? Who is to believe me,—who is to\n",
      "think him innocent, if you, who know'd him so well, stick to it he's guilty?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm loth enough to do it, lass,\" replied Job; \"but I think he's been ill used, and—jilted\n",
      "(that's plain truth, Mary, hard as it may seem), and his blood has been up—many a man has done the\n",
      "like afore, from like causes.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, God! Then you won't help me, Job, to prove him innocent? Oh! Job, Job; believe me, Jem never\n",
      "did harm to no one.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not afore;—and mind, wench! I don't over-blame him for this.\" Job relapsed into silence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary thought a moment.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Job, you'll not refuse me this, I know. I won't mind what you think, if you'll help me as\n",
      "if he was innocent. Now suppose I know—I knew he was innocent,—it's only supposing, Job,—what must I\n",
      "do to prove it? Tell me, Job! Isn't it called an <hi>alibi</hi>, the getting folk to swear to where\n",
      "he really was at the time?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Best way, if you know'd him innocent, would be to find out the real murderer. Some one did it,\n",
      "that's clear enough. If it wasn't Jem, who was it?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How can I tell?\" answered Mary, in an agony of terror, lest Job's question was prompted by any\n",
      "suspicion of the truth.</p>\n",
      "<p>But he was far enough from any such thought. Indeed, he had no doubt in his own mind that Jem\n",
      "had, in some passionate moment, urged on by slighted love and jealousy, been the murderer. And he\n",
      "was strongly inclined to believe, that Mary was aware of this, only that, too late repentant of her\n",
      "light conduct which had led to such fatal consequences, she was now most anxious to save her old\n",
      "play-fellow, her early friend, from the doom awaiting the shedder of blood.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If Jem's not done it, I don't see as any on us can tell who did. We might find out something if\n",
      "we'd time; but they say he's to be tried on Tuesday. It's no use hiding it, Mary; things looks\n",
      "strong against him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I know they do! I know they do! But, oh! Job! isn't an <hi>alibi</hi> a proving where he really\n",
      "was at th' time of the murder; and how must I set about an <hi>alibi</hi>?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"An <hi>alibi</hi> is that, sure enough.\" He thought a little. \"You mun ask his mother his\n",
      "doings, and his whereabouts that night; the knowledge of that will guide you a bit.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>For he was anxious that on another should fall the task of enlightening Mary on the hopelessness\n",
      "of the case, and he felt that her own sense would be more convinced by inquiry and examination than\n",
      "any mere assertion of his.</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret had sat silent and grave all this time. To tell the truth, she was surprised and\n",
      "disappointed by the disclosure of Mary's conduct, with regard to Mr. Henry Carson. Gentle, reserved,\n",
      "and prudent herself, never exposed to the trial of being admired for her personal appearance, and\n",
      "unsusceptible enough to be in doubt even yet, whether the fluttering, tender, infinitely-joyous\n",
      "feeling she was for the first time experiencing, at sight, or sound, or thought of Will Wilson, was\n",
      "love or not,—Margaret had no sympathy with the temptations to which loveliness, vanity, ambition, or\n",
      "the desire of being admired, exposes so many; no sympathy with flirting girls, in short. Then, she\n",
      "had no idea of the strength of the conflict between will and principle in some who were differently\n",
      "constituted from herself. With her, to be convinced that an action was wrong, was tantamount to a\n",
      "determination not to do so again; and she had little or no difficulty in carrying out her\n",
      "determination. So she could not understand how it was that Mary had acted wrongly, and had felt too\n",
      "much ashamed, in spite of all internal sophistry, to speak of her actions. Margaret considered\n",
      "herself deceived; felt aggrieved; and, at the time of which I am now telling you, was strongly\n",
      "inclined to give Mary up altogether, as a girl devoid of the modest proprieties of her sex, and\n",
      "capable of gross duplicity, in speaking of one lover as she had done of Jem, while she was\n",
      "encouraging another in attentions, at best of a very doubtful character.</p>\n",
      "<p>But now Margaret was drawn into the conversation. Suddenly it flashed across Mary's mind, that\n",
      "the night of the murder was the very night, or rather the same early morning, that Margaret had been\n",
      "with Alice. She turned sharp round, with—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! Margaret, you can tell me; you were there when he came back that night; were you not? No!\n",
      "you were not; but you were there not many hours after. Did not you hear where he'd been? He was away\n",
      "the night before, too, when Alice was first taken; when you were there for your tea. Oh! where was\n",
      "he, Margaret?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't know,\" she answered. \"Stay! I do remember something about his keeping Will company, in\n",
      "his walk to Liverpool. I can't justly say what it was, so much happened that night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll go to his mother's,\" said Mary, resolutely.</p>\n",
      "<p>They neither of them spoke, either to advise or dissuade. Mary felt she had no sympathy from\n",
      "them, and braced up her soul to act without such loving aid of friendship. She knew that their\n",
      "advice would be willingly given at her demand, and that was all she really required for Jem's sake.\n",
      "Still her courage failed a little as she walked to Jane Wilson's, alone in the world with her\n",
      "secret.</p>\n",
      "<p>Jane Wilson's eyes were swelled with crying; and it was sad to see the ravages which intense\n",
      "anxiety and sorrow had made on her appearance in four-and-twenty hours. All night long she and Mrs.\n",
      "Davenport had crooned over their sorrows, always recurring, like the burden of an old song, to the\n",

      "fresh from the heart; and the old woman insensibly gave herself up to the influence of those sweet,\n",

      "<p>\"Nay! how should I know? Policeman said he'd call again towards evening, and see if you'd getten\n",

      "<p>\"Well! yo can read word of writing and I cannot, so it's queer I should have to tell you. But my\n",

      "<p>\"God pity me!\" said Mary, faintly, as white as a sheet.</p>\n",

      "<p>She left the house, but Mary did not know it. She sat still with the parchment in her hand.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"A sub-pœna is neither more nor less than this, my dear. It's a summonsing you to attend, and\n",

      "Henry Carson; that's the long and short of it, only more elegantly put, for the benefit of them who\n",
      "knows how to value the gift of language. I've been a witness before-time myself; there's nothing\n",

      "tat.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nothing much to be afeared on!\" echoed Mary, but in such a different tone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, poor wench, I see how it is. It'll go hard with thee a bit, I dare say; but keep up thy\n",
      "heart. Yo cannot have much to tell 'em, that can go either one way or th' other. Nay! may be thou\n",
      "may do him a bit o' good, for when they set eyes on thee, they'll see fast enough how he came to be\n",
      "so led away by jealousy; for thou'rt a pretty creature, Mary, and one look at thy face will let 'em\n",
      "into th' secret of a young man's madness, and make 'em more ready to pass it over.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! Job, and won't you ever believe me when I tell you he's innocent? Indeed, and indeed I can\n",
      "prove it; he was with Will all that night; he was, indeed, Job!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My wench! whose word hast thou for that?\" said Job, pityingly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why! his mother told me, and I'll get Will to bear witness to it. But, oh! Job\" (bursting into\n",
      "tears), \"it is hard if you won't believe me. How shall I clear him to strangers, when those who know\n",

      "<p>\"Oh, Job! if you will help me,\" exclaimed Mary, brightening up (though it was but a wintry gleam\n",

      "<p>\"Thou canst do nought better than tell the truth. Truth's best at all times, they say; and for\n",

      "should have clean forgotten all about it, and say the very thing I should not.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, well, don't go for to get such notions into your head; they're what they call 'narvous,'\n",

      "<p>Mary shrank as if from a cold blast—shrank from Margaret! The blind girl, with her reserve, her\n",
      "silence, seemed to be a severe judge; she, listening, would be such a check to the trusting\n",
      "earnestness of confidence, which was beginning to unlock the sympathy of Job. Mary knew herself to\n",
      "blame; felt her errors in every fibre of her heart; but yet she would rather have had them spoken\n",
      "about, even in terms of severest censure, than have been treated in the icy manner in which Margaret\n",

      "<p>\"Here's Mary,\" said Job, almost as if he wished to propitiate his grand-daughter, \"come to take a\n",

      "she looks as wan and pale as a ghost.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It was calling out the feeling of hospitality, so strong and warm in most of those who have\n",
      "little to offer, but whose heart goes eagerly and kindly with that little. Margaret came towards\n",
      "Mary with a welcoming gesture, and a kinder manner by far than she had used in the morning.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay, Mary, thou know'st thou'st getten nought at home,\" urged Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>And Mary, faint and weary, and with a heart too aching-full of other matters to be pertinacious\n",
      "in this, withdrew her refusal.</p>\n",
      "<p>They ate their dinner quietly; for to all it was an effort to speak, and after one or two\n",
      "attempts they had subsided into silence.</p>\n",
      "<p>When the meal was ended Job began again on the subject they all had at heart.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yon poor lad at Kirkdale will want a lawyer to see they don't put on him, but do him justice.\n",
      "Hast thought of that?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary had not, and felt sure his mother had not.</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret confirmed this last supposition.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I've but just been there, and poor Jane is like one dateless; so many griefs come on her at\n",
      "once. One time she seems to make sure he'll be hung; and if I took her in that way, she flew out\n",
      "(poor body!) and said, that in spite of what folk said, there were them as could, and would prove\n",
      "him guiltless. So I never knew where to have her. The only thing she was constant in, was declaring\n",
      "him innocent.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother-like!\" said Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She meant Will, when she spoke of them that could prove him innocent. He was with Will on\n",
      "Thursday night, walking a part of the way with him to Liverpool; now the thing is to lay hold on\n",
      "Will and get him to prove this.\" So spoke Mary, calm, from the earnestness of her purpose.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't build too much on it, my dear,\" said Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I do build on it,\" replied Mary, \"because I know it's the truth, and I mean to try and prove it,\n",
      "come what may. Nothing you can say will daunt me, Job, so don't you go and try. You may help, but\n",
      "you cannot hinder me doing what I'm resolved on.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They respected her firmness of determination, and Job almost gave in to her belief, when he saw\n",
      "how steadfastly she was acting upon it. Oh! surest way of conversion to our faith, whatever it may\n",
      "be,—regarding either small things, or great,—when it is beheld as the actuating principle, from\n",
      "which we never swerve! When it is seen that, instead of over-much profession, it is worked into the\n",
      "life, and moves every action!</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary gained courage as she instinctively felt she had made way with one at least of her\n",
      "companions.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Now I'm clear about this much,\" she continued, \"he was with Will when the—shot was fired (she\n",
      "could not bring herself to say, when the murder was committed, when she remembered <hi>who</hi> it\n",
      "was that, she had every reason to believe, was the taker-away of life). Will can prove this. I must\n",

      "keep. I'll take this,\" accepting a sovereign from the hoard which Margaret produced out of its\n",
      "accustomed place in the cupboard. \"Your grandfather will pay the lawyer. I'll have nought to do with\n",

      "truth, sooner or later; and knowing what was the secret she had to hide.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Bless you! don't make such ado about it,\" said Margaret, cutting short Mary's thanks. \"I\n",

      "as you would do unto them,' for pride often prevents our giving others a great deal of pleasure, in\n",
      "not letting them be kind, when their hearts are longing to help; and when we ourselves should wish\n",
      "to do just the same, if we were in their place. Oh! how often I've been hurt, by being coldly told\n",
      "by persons not to trouble myself about their care, or sorrow, when I saw them in great grief, and\n",
      "wanted to be of comfort. Our Lord Jesus was not above letting folk minister to Him, for He knew how\n",

      "<p>Mary had been too much engrossed by watching what was passing in the street to attend very\n",

      "plainly, and she caught sight of a gentleman walking alongside of Job, evidently in earnest\n",
      "conversation with him, and looking keen and penetrating enough to be a lawyer. Job was laying down\n",
      "something to be attended to she could see, by his up-lifted fore-finger, and his whole gesture; then\n",
      "he pointed and nodded across the street to his own house, as if inducing his companion to come in.\n",
      "Mary dreaded lest he should, and she be subjected to a closer cross-examination than she had\n",
      "hitherto undergone, as to why she was so certain that Jem was innocent. She feared he was coming; he\n",
      "stepped a little towards the spot. No! it was only to make way for a child, tottering along, whom\n",
      "Mary had overlooked. Now Job took him by the button, so earnestly familiar had he grown. The\n",
      "gentleman looked \"fidging fain\" to be gone, but submitted in a manner that made Mary like him in\n",
      "spite of his profession. Then came a volley of last words, answered by briefest nods, and\n",
      "monosyllables; and then the stranger went off with redoubled quickness of pace, and Job crossed the\n",
      "street with a little satisfied air of importance on his kindly face.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well! Mary,\" said he on entering, \"I've seen the lawyer, not Mr. Cheshire though; trials for\n",
      "murder, it seems, are not his line o' business. But he gived me a note to another 'torney; a fine\n",
      "fellow enough, only too much of a talker; I could hardly get a word in, he cut me so short. However,\n",
      "I've just been going over the principal points again to him; may be you saw us? I wanted him just to\n",
      "come over and speak to you himsel, Mary, but he was pressed for time; and he said your evidence\n",
      "would not be much either here or there. He's going to the 'sizes first train on Monday morning, and\n",

      "satisfactory arrangements, as he considered them, only seemed to bring the circumstances in which\n",
      "she was placed more vividly home to Mary. They convinced her that it was real, and not all a dream,\n",
      "as she had sunk into fancying it for a few minutes, while sitting in the old accustomed place, her\n",
      "body enjoying the rest, and her frame sustained by food, and listening to Margaret's calm voice. The\n",
      "gentleman she had just beheld would see and question Jem in a few hours, and what would be the\n",
      "result?</p>\n",
      "<p>Monday: that was the day after to-morrow, and on Tuesday, life and death would be tremendous\n",

      "Liverpool.' He'll be lodging there.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job ceased talking, and the silence roused Mary up to thank him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You're very kind, Job; very. You and Margaret won't desert me, come what will.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Pooh! pooh! wench; don't lose heart, just as I'm beginning to get it. He seems to think a deal\n",

      "<p>To be sure, there were one or two passengers on that morning whose objects were less innocent and\n",
      "less praiseworthy than those of the people I have already mentioned, and whose animal state of mind\n",
      "and body clashed jarringly on the peacefulness of the day; but upon them I will not dwell: as you\n",
      "and I, and almost every one, I think, may send up our individual cry of self-reproach that we have\n",
      "not done all that we could for the stray and wandering ones of our brethren.</p>\n",
      "<p>When Mary turned from the window, she went to the bed of each sleeper, to look and listen. Alice\n",
      "looked perfectly quiet and happy in her slumber, and her face seemed to have become much more\n",
      "youthful during her painless approach to death.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Wilson's countenance was stamped with the anxiety of the last few days, although she, too,\n",
      "appeared sleeping soundly; but as Mary gazed on her, trying to trace a likeness to her son in her\n",

      "her own.</p>\n",
      "<p>Both were silent for a minute or two. Mary's eyes had fallen beneath that penetrating gaze, in\n",
      "which the agony of memory seemed every moment to find fuller vent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Is it a dream?\" the mother asked at last in a low voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No!\" replied Mary, in the same tone.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Wilson hid her face in the pillow.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was fully conscious of every thing this morning; it was evident that the stunning effect of\n",
      "the subpœna, which had affected her so much last night in her weak, worn-out state, had passed away.\n",
      "Mary offered no opposition when she indicated by languid gesture and action that she wished to rise.\n",
      "A sleepless bed is a haunted place.</p>\n",
      "<p>When she was dressed with Mary's help, she stood by Alice for a minute or two, looking at the\n",
      "slumberer.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How happy she is!\" said she, quietly and sadly.</p>\n",
      "<p>All the time that Mary was getting breakfast ready, and performing every other little domestic\n",
      "office she could think of, to add to the comfort of Jem's mother, Mrs. Wilson sat still in the\n",
      "arm-chair, watching her silently. Her old irritation of temper and manner seemed to have suddenly\n",
      "disappeared, or perhaps she was too depressed in body and mind to show it.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary told her all that had been done with regard to Mr. Bridgenorth; all her own plans for\n",
      "seeking out Will; all her hopes; and concealed as well as she could all the doubts and fears that\n",
      "would arise unbidden. To this Mrs. Wilson listened without much remark, but with deep interest and\n",
      "perfect comprehension. When Mary ceased she sighed and said, \"Oh wench! I am his mother, and yet I\n",
      "do so little, I can do so little! That's what frets me! I seem like a child as sees its mammy ill,\n",
      "and moans and cries its little heart out, yet does nought to help. I think my sense has left me all\n",
      "at once, and I can't even find strength to cry like the little child.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Hereupon she broke into a feeble wail of self-reproach, that her outward show of misery was not\n",
      "greater; as if any cries, or tears, or loud-spoken words could have told of such pangs at the heart\n",
      "as that look, and that thin, piping, altered voice!</p>\n",
      "<p>But think of Mary and what she was enduring! Picture to yourself (for I cannot tell you) the\n",
      "armies of thoughts that met and clashed in her brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her to be\n",
      "calm, and quiet, and even, in a faint way, cheerful and smiling at times.</p>\n",
      "<p>After a while she began to stir about in her own mind for some means of sparing the poor mother\n",
      "the trial of appearing as a witness in the matter of the gun. She had made no allusion to her\n",
      "summons this morning, and Mary almost thought she must have forgotten it; and surely some means\n",
      "might be found to prevent that additional sorrow. She must see Job about it; nay, if necessary, she\n",
      "must see Mr. Bridgenorth, with all his truth-compelling powers; for, indeed, she had so struggled\n",
      "and triumphed (though a sadly-bleeding victor at heart) over herself these two last days, had so\n",
      "concealed agony, and hidden her inward woe and bewilderment, that she began to take confidence, and\n",
      "to have faith in her own powers of meeting any one with a passably fair show, whatever might be\n",
      "rending her life beneath the cloak of her deception.</p>\n",
      "<p>Accordingly, as soon as Mrs. Davenport came in after morning church, to ask after the two lone\n",
      "women, and she had heard the report Mary had to give (so much better as regarded Mrs. Wilson than\n",
      "what they had feared the night before it would have been)—as soon as this kind-hearted, grateful\n",
      "woman came in, Mary, telling her her purpose, went off to fetch the doctor who attended Alice.</p>\n",
      "<p>He was shaking himself after his morning's round, and happy in the anticipation of his Sunday's\n",
      "dinner; but he was a good-tempered man, who found it difficult to keep down his jovial easiness even\n",
      "by the bed of sickness or death. He had mischosen his profession; for it was his delight to see\n",
      "every one around him in full enjoyment of life.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, he subdued his face to the proper expression of sympathy, befitting a doctor listening\n",
      "to a patient, or a patient's friend (and Mary's sad, pale, anxious face might be taken for either\n",
      "the one or the other).</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, my girl! and what brings you here?\" said he, as he entered his surgery. \"Not on your own\n",
      "account, I hope.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wanted you to come and see Alice Wilson,—and then I thought you would may be take a look at\n",
      "Mrs. Wilson.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He bustled on his hat and coat, and followed Mary instantly.</p>\n",
      "<p>After shaking his head over Alice (as if it was a mournful thing for one so pure and good, so\n",
      "true, although so humble a Christian, to be nearing her desired haven), and muttering the accustomed\n",
      "words intended to destroy hope, and prepare anticipation, he went in compliance with Mary's look to\n",
      "ask the usual questions of Mrs. Wilson, who sat passively in her arm-chair.</p>\n",
      "<p>She answered his questions, and submitted to his examination.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How do you think her?\" asked Mary, eagerly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why—a,\" began he, perceiving that he was desired to take one side in his answer, and unable to\n",
      "find out whether his listener was anxious for a favourable verdict or otherwise; but thinking it\n",
      "most probable that she would desire the former, he continued,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She is weak, certainly; the natural result of such a shock as the arrest of her son would\n",
      "be,—for I understand this James Wilson, who murdered Mr. Carson, was her son. Sad thing to have such\n",
      "a reprobate in the family.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You say '<hi>who murdered</hi>,' sir!\" said Mary, indignantly. \"He is only taken up on\n",
      "suspicion, and many have no doubt of his innocence—those who know him, sir.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ah, well, well! doctors have seldom time to read newspapers, and I dare say I'm not very correct\n",
      "in my story. I dare say he's innocent; I'm sure I had no right to say otherwise,—only words slip\n",
      "out.—No! indeed, young woman, I see no cause for apprehension about this poor creature in the next\n",
      "room;—weak—certainly; but a day or two's good nursing will set her up, and I'm sure you're a good\n",
      "nurse, my dear, from your pretty, kind-hearted face,—I'll send a couple of pills and a draught, but\n",
      "don't alarm yourself,—there's no occasion, I assure you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But you don't think her fit to go to Liverpool?\" asked Mary, still in the anxious tone of one\n",
      "who wishes earnestly for some particular decision.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To Liverpool—yes,\" replied he. \"A short journey like that could not fatigue, and might distract\n",
      "her thoughts. Let her go by all means,—it would be the very thing for her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, sir!\" burst out Mary, almost sobbing; \"I did so hope you would say she was too ill to\n",
      "go.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Whew—\" said he, with a prolonged whistle, trying to understand the case, but being, as he said,\n",
      "no reader of newspapers, utterly unaware of the peculiar reasons there might be for so apparently\n",
      "unfeeling a wish,—\"Why did you not tell me so sooner? It might certainly do her harm in her weak\n",
      "state; there is always some risk attending journeys—draughts, and what not. To her, they might prove\n",
      "very injurious,—very. I disapprove of journeys, or excitement, in all cases where the patient is in\n",
      "the low, fluttered state in which Mrs. Wilson is. If you take <hi>my</hi> advice, you will certainly\n",
      "put a stop to all thoughts of going to Liverpool.\" He really had completely changed his opinion,\n",
      "though quite unconsciously; so desirous was he to comply with the wishes of others.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, sir, thank you! And will you give me a certificate of her being unable to go, if the lawyer\n",
      "says we must have one? The lawyer, you know,\" continued she, seeing him look puzzled, \"who is to\n",
      "defend Jem,—it was as a witness against him—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My dear girl!\" said he, almost angrily, \"why did you not state the case fully at first? one\n",
      "minute would have done it,—and my dinner waiting all this time. To be sure she can't go,—it would be\n",
      "madness to think of it; if her evidence could have done good, it would have been a different thing.\n",
      "Come to me for the certificate any time; that is to say, if the lawyer advises you. I second the\n",
      "lawyer; take counsel with both the learned professions—ha, ha, ha,—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And laughing at his own joke, he departed, leaving Mary accusing herself of stupidity in having\n",
      "imagined that every one was as well acquainted with the facts concerning the trial as she was\n",
      "herself; for indeed she had never doubted that the doctor would have been aware of the purpose of\n",
      "poor Mrs. Wilson's journey to Liverpool.</p>\n",
      "<p>Presently she went to Job (the ever-ready Mrs. Davenport keeping watch over the two old women),\n",
      "and told him her fears, her plans, and her proceedings.</p>\n",
      "<p>To her surprise he shook his head doubtfully.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It may have an awkward look, if we keep her back. Lawyers is up to tricks.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But it's no trick,\" said Mary. \"She is so poorly, she was last night, at least; and to-day she's\n",
      "so faded and weak.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Poor soul! I dare say. I only mean for Jem's sake; as so much is known, it won't do now to hang\n",
      "back. But I'll ask Mr. Bridgenorth. I'll e'en take your doctor's advice. Yo tarry at home, and I'll\n",

      "<p>She was really curious to see Mary; her connexion with a murderer seemed to have made her into a\n",
      "sort of <hi>lusus naturæ</hi>, and was almost, by some, expected to have made a change in her\n",
      "personal appearance, so earnestly did they stare at her. But Mary had been too much absorbed this\n",
      "last day or two to notice this.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now Sally had a grand view, and looked her over and over (a very different thing from looking her\n",
      "through and through), and almost learnt her off by heart;—\"her every-day gown (Hoyle's print you\n",
      "know, that lilac thing with the high body) she was so fond of; a little black silk handkerchief just\n",
      "knotted round her neck, like a boy; her hair all taken back from her face, as if she wanted to keep\n",
      "her head cool—she would always keep that hair of hers so long; and her hands twitching continually\n",
      "about.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Such particulars would make Sally into a Gazette Extraordinary the next morning at the work-room,\n",
      "and were worth coming for, even if little else could be extracted from Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, Mary!\" she began. \"Where have you hidden yourself? You never showed your face all yesterday\n",
      "at Miss Simmonds'. You don't fancy we think any the worse of you for what's come and gone. Some on\n",
      "us, indeed, were a bit sorry for the poor young man, as lies stiff and cold for your sake, Mary; but\n",
      "we shall ne'er cast it up against you. Miss Simmonds, too, will be mighty put out if you don't come,\n",
      "for there's a deal of mourning, agait.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I can't,\" Mary said, in a low voice. \"I don't mean ever to come again.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, Mary!\" said Sally, in unfeigned surprise. \"To be sure you'll have to be in Liverpool,\n",
      "Tuesday, and may be Wednesday; but after that you'll surely come, and tell us all about it. Miss\n",
      "Simmonds knows you'll have to be off those two days. But between you and me, she's a bit of a\n",
      "gossip, and will like hearing all how and about the trial, well enough to let you off very easy for\n",
      "your being absent a day or two. Besides, Betsy Morgan was saying yesterday, she shouldn't wonder but\n",
      "you'd prove quite an attraction to customers. Many a one would come and have their gowns made by\n",
      "Miss Simmonds just to catch a glimpse at you, at after the trial's over. Really, Mary, you'll turn\n",
      "out quite a heroine.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The little fingers twitched worse than ever; the large soft eyes looked up pleadingly into\n",
      "Sally's face; but she went on in the same strain, not from any unkind or cruel feeling towards Mary,\n",
      "but solely because she was incapable of comprehending her suffering.</p>\n",
      "<p>She had been shocked, of course, at Mr. Carson's death, though at the same time the excitement\n",
      "was rather pleasant than otherwise; and dearly now would she have enjoyed the conspicuous notice\n",

      "shouldn't wonder\" (in a comforting tone, and really believing she was giving comfort) \"if you picked\n",

      "<p>\"Oh, I don't know and don't care,\" exclaimed Mary, sick and weary of her visitor.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, then! take my advice, and go in that blue merino. It's old to be sure, and a bit worn at\n",
      "elbows, but folk won't notice that, and th' colour suits you. Now mind, Mary. And I'll lend you my\n",
      "black watered scarf,\" added she, really good-naturedly, according to her sense of things, and\n",
      "withal, a little bit pleased at the idea of her pet article of dress figuring away on the person of\n",
      "a witness at a trial for murder.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll bring it to-morrow before you start.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, don't!\" said Mary; \"thank you, but I don't want it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, what can you wear? I know all your clothes as well as I do my own, and what is there you\n",
      "can wear? Not your old plaid shawl, I do hope? You would not fancy this I have on, more nor the\n",
      "scarf, would you?\" said she, brightening up at the thought, and willing to lend it, or any thing\n",
      "else.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh Sally! don't go on talking a-that-ns; how can I think on dress at such a time? When it's a\n",

      "<p>\"Bless the girl! It's Jem, is it? Well now, I thought there was some sweetheart in the\n",
      "back-ground, when you flew off so with Mr. Carson. Then what in the name of goodness made him shoot\n",
      "Mr. Harry? After you had given up going with him, I mean? Was he afraid you'd be on again?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry?\" asked Mary, firing up from the state of languid\n",
      "indifference into which she had sunk while Sally had been settling about her dress. \"But it's no\n",

      "guilty as did know him,\" she said, sinking back into her former depressed tone and manner.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And don't you think he did it?\" asked Sally.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary paused; she was going on too fast with one so curious and so unscrupulous. Besides she\n",
      "remembered how even she herself had, at first, believed him guilty; and she felt it was not for her\n",
      "to cast stones at those who, on similar evidence, inclined to the same belief. None had given him\n",
      "much benefit of a doubt. None had faith in his innocence. None but his mother; and there the heart\n",
      "loved more than the head reasoned, and her yearning affection had never for an instant entertained\n",
      "the idea that her Jem was a murderer. But Mary disliked the whole conversation; the subject, the\n",
      "manner in which it was treated, were all painful, and she had a repugnance to the person with whom\n",
      "she spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was thankful, therefore, when Job Legh's voice was heard at the door, as he stood with the\n",

      "that old fogey coming in here, as I'm alive! Did your father set him to look after you while he was\n",
      "away? or what brings the old chap here? However, I'm off; I never could abide either him or his prim\n",

      "you're quite welcome to it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She and Job passed each other at the door, with mutual looks of dislike, which neither took any\n",
      "pains to conceal.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yon's a bold, bad girl,\" said Job to Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She's very good-natured,\" replied Mary, too honourable to abuse a visitor who had only that\n",

      "character.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, ay! good-natured, generous, jolly, full of fun; there are a number of other names for the\n",

      "be led astray by one who was every way bad? Howe'er, that's not what I came to talk about. I've seen\n",
      "Mr. Bridgenorth, and he is in a manner of the same mind as me; he thinks it would have an awkward\n",

      "be helped.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't know if she's so bad as all that,\" said Mary, who began to dread her part in doing any\n",
      "thing which might tell against her poor lover.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Will you come and see her, Job? The doctor seemed to say as I liked, not as he thought.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's because he had no great thought on the subject, either one way or t'other,\" replied Job,\n",
      "whose contempt for medical men pretty nearly equalled his respect for lawyers. \"But I'll go and\n",
      "welcome. I han not seen th' oud ladies since their sorrows, and it's but manners to go and ax after\n",

      "<p>The room at Mrs. Wilson's had that still, changeless look you must have often observed in the\n",

      "noiseless and hushed; the furniture all arranged and stationary, with a view to the comfort of the\n",
      "afflicted; the window-blinds drawn down to keep out the disturbing variety of a sun-beam; the same\n",

      "would not think it), that may keep up his heart. I missed seeing him ere he went to yon prison, but\n",
      "nought shall keep me away again one minute when I can see his face; for maybe the minutes are\n",
      "numbered, and the count but small. I know I can be a comfort to him, poor lad. You would not think\n",
      "it, now, but he'd alway speak as kind and soft to me as if he were courting me, like. He loved me\n",
      "above a bit; and am I to leave him now to dree all the cruel slander they'll put upon him? I can\n",
      "pray for him at each hard word they say against him, if I can do nought else; and he'll know what\n",
      "his mother is doing for him, poor lad, by the look on my face.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Still they made some look, or gesture of opposition to her wishes. She turned sharp round on\n",
      "Mary, the old object of her pettish attacks, and said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Now, wench! once for all! I tell yo this. <hi>He</hi> could never guide me; and he'd sense\n",
      "enough not to try. What he could na do, don't you try. I shall go to Liverpool to-morrow, and find\n",
      "my lad, and stay with him through thick and thin; and if he dies, why, perhaps, God of His mercy\n",
      "will take me too. The grave is a sure cure for an aching heart.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She sank back in her chair, quite exhausted by the sudden effort she had made; but if they even\n",
      "offered to speak, she cut them short (whatever the subject might be), with the repetition of the\n",
      "same words, \"I shall go to Liverpool.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>No more could be said, the doctor's opinion had been so undecided; Mr. Bridgenorth had given his\n",

      "remain at home, if indeed under all the circumstances it could be thought desirable.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Best way will be,\" said Job, \"for me to hunt out Will, early to-morrow morning, and yo, Mary,\n",
      "come at after with Jane Wilson. I know a decent woman where yo two can have a bed, and where we may\n",

      "him, I'll not trust none of his clerks for hunting up Will, if Jem's life is to depend on it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Now Mary disliked this plan inexpressibly; her dislike was partly grounded on reason, and partly\n",
      "on feeling. She could not bear the idea of deputing to any one the active measures necessary to be\n",
      "taken in order to save Jem. She felt as if they were her duty, her right. She durst not trust to any\n",
      "one the completion of her plan; they might not have energy, or perseverance, or desperation enough\n",
      "to follow out the slightest chance; and her love would endow her with all these qualities,\n",
      "independently of the terrible alternative which awaited her in case all failed and Jem was\n",
      "condemned. No one could have her motives; and consequently no one could have her sharpened brain,\n",
      "her despairing determination. Besides (only that was purely selfish), she could not endure the\n",
      "suspense of remaining quiet, and only knowing the result when all was accomplished.</p>\n",
      "<p>So with vehemence and impatience she rebutted every reason Job adduced for his plan; and of\n",

      "would perhaps fancy it might have been different; do, grandfather, let her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret had still, you see, little or no belief in Jem's innocence; and besides, she thought if\n",
      "Mary saw Will, and heard herself from him that Jem had not been with him that Thursday night, it\n",
      "would in a measure break the force of the blow which was impending.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Let me lock up house, grandfather, for a couple of days, and go and stay with Alice. It's but\n",

      "dear grandad, and let Mary go find Will, and you can all meet together at after, and I'm sure I wish\n",
      "you luck.\"</p>\n",

      "old man who had been so positive only a few minutes before.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary was thankful for Margaret's interference. She did not speak, but threw her arms round\n",

      "half-running steps.</p>\n",
      "<p>Presently he slackened his pace sufficiently to enable him to enter into conversation with Mary,\n",
      "for once escaped from the reach of his mother's recalling voice, he thought he might venture to\n",
      "indulge his curiosity.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ahem!—What's your name? It's so awkward to be calling you young woman.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My name is Mary,—Mary Barton,\" answered she, anxious to propitiate one who seemed so willing to\n",
      "exert himself in her behalf, or else she grudged every word which caused the slightest relaxation in\n",
      "her speed, although her chest seemed tightened, and her head throbbing, from the rate at which they\n",
      "were walking.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And you want Will Wilson to prove an <hi>alibi</hi>—is that it?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes—oh, yes—can we not cross now?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, wait a minute; it's the teagle hoisting above your head I'm afraid of;—and who is it that's\n",
      "to be tried?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem; oh, lad! can't we get past?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They rushed under the great bales quivering in the air above their heads and pressed onwards for\n",
      "a few minutes, till Master Charley again saw fit to walk a little slower, and ask a few more\n",
      "questions.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary, is Jem your brother, or your sweetheart, that you're so set upon saving him?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No—no,\" replied she, but with something of hesitation, that made the shrewd boy yet more anxious\n",
      "to clear up the mystery.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Perhaps he's your cousin, then? Many a girl has a cousin who has not a sweetheart.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, he's neither kith nor kin to me. What's the matter? What are you stopping for?\" said she,\n",
      "with nervous terror, as Charley turned back a few steps, and peered up a side street.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, nothing to flurry you so, Mary. I heard you say to mother you had never been in Liverpool\n",
      "before, and if you'll only look up this street you may see the back windows of our Exchange. Such a\n",
      "building as yon is! with 'natomy hiding under a blanket, and Lord Admiral Nelson, and a few more\n",
      "people in the middle of the court! No! come here,\" as Mary, in her eagerness, was looking at any\n",
      "window that caught her eye first, to satisfy the boy. \"Here, then, now you can see it. You can say,\n",
      "now, you've seen Liverpool Exchange.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, to be sure—it's a beautiful window, I'm sure. But are we near the boats? I'll stop as I\n",
      "come back, you know; only I think we'd better get on now.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! if the wind's in your favour, you'll be down the river in no time, and catch Will, I'll be\n",
      "bound; and if it's not, why, you know, the minute it took you to look at the Exchange will be\n",
      "neither here nor there.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Another rush onwards, till one of the long crossings near the docks caused a stoppage, and gave\n",
      "Mary time for breathing, and Charley leisure to ask another question.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You've never said where you come from?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Manchester,\" replied she.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Eh, then! you've a power of things to see. Liverpool beats Manchester hollow, they say. A nasty,\n",
      "smoky hole, bean't it? Are you bound to live there?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, yes! it's my home.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, I don't think I could abide a home in the middle of smoke. Look there! now you see the\n",
      "river! That's something now you'd give a deal for in Manchester. Look!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And Mary did look, and saw down an opening made in the forest of masts belonging to the vessels\n",
      "in dock, the glorious river, along which white-sailed ships were gliding with the ensigns of all\n",
      "nations, not \"braving the battle,\" but telling of the distant lands, spicy or frozen, that sent to\n",
      "that mighty mart for their comforts or their luxuries; she saw small boats passing to and fro on\n",
      "that glittering highway, but she also saw such puffs and clouds of smoke from the countless\n",
      "steamers, that she wondered at Charley's intolerance of the smoke of Manchester. Across the\n",
      "swing-bridge, along the pier,—and they stood breathless by a magnificent dock, where hundreds of\n",
      "ships lay motionless during the process of loading and unloading. The cries of the sailors, the\n",
      "variety of languages used by the passers-by, and the entire novelty of the sight compared with any\n",
      "thing which Mary had ever seen, made her feel most helpless and forlorn; and she clung to her young\n",
      "guide as to one who alone by his superior knowledge could interpret between her and the new race of\n",
      "men by whom she was surrounded,—for a new race sailors might reasonably be considered, to a girl who\n",
      "had hitherto seen none but inland dwellers, and those for the greater part factory people.</p>\n",
      "<p>In that new world of sight and sound, she still bore one prevailing thought, and though her eye\n",
      "glanced over the ships and the wide-spreading river, her mind was full of the thought of reaching\n",
      "Will.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why are we here?\" asked she of Charley. \"There are no little boats about, and I thought I was to\n",
      "go in a little boat; those ships are never meant for short distances, are they?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To be sure not,\" replied he, rather contemptuously. \"But the <hi>John Cropper</hi> lay in this\n",
      "dock, and I know many of the sailors; and if I could see one I knew, I'd ask him to run up the mast,\n",
      "and see if he could catch a sight of her in the offing. If she's weighed her anchor no use for your\n",
      "going, you know.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary assented quietly to this speech, as if she were as careless as Charley seemed now to be\n",
      "about her overtaking Will; but in truth her heart was sinking within her, and she no longer felt the\n",
      "energy which had hitherto upheld her. Her bodily strength was giving way, and she stood cold and\n",
      "shivering, although the noon-day sun beat down with considerable power on the shadeless spot where\n",
      "she was standing.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Here's Tom Bourne!\" said Charley; and altering his manner from the patronising key in which he\n",
      "had spoken to Mary, he addressed a weather-beaten old sailor who came rolling along the pathway\n",
      "where they stood, his hands in his pockets, and his quid in his mouth, with very much the air of one\n",
      "who had nothing to do but look about him, and spit right and left; addressing this old tar, Charley\n",
      "made known to him his wish in slang, which to Mary was almost inaudible, and quite unintelligible,\n",
      "and which I am too much of a land-lubber to repeat correctly.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary watched looks and actions with a renovated keenness of perception.</p>\n",
      "<p>She saw the old man listen attentively to Charley; she saw him eye her over from head to foot,\n",
      "and wind up his inspection with a little nod of approbation (for her very shabbiness and poverty of\n",
      "dress were creditable signs to the experienced old sailor); and then she watched him leisurely swing\n",
      "himself on to a ship in the basin, and, borrowing a glass, run up the mast with the speed of a\n",
      "monkey.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He'll fall!\" said she, in affright, clutching at Charley's arm, and judging the sailor, from his\n",
      "storm-marked face and unsteady walk on land, to be much older than he really was.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not he!\" said Charley. \"He's at the mast-head now. See! he's looking through his glass, and\n",
      "using his arms as steady as if he were on dry land. Why, I've been up the mast, many and many a\n",
      "time; only don't tell mother. She thinks I'm to be a shoemaker, but I've made up my mind to be a\n",
      "sailor; only there's no good arguing with a woman. You'll not tell her, Mary?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, see!\" exclaimed she (his secret was very safe with her, for, in fact, she had not heard it).\n",
      "\"See! he's coming down; he's down. Speak to him, Charley.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But unable to wait another instant she called out herself,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Can you see the <hi>John Cropper</hi>? Is she there yet?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, ay,\" he answered, and coming quickly up to them, he hurried them away to seek for a boat,\n",
      "saying the bar was already covered, and in an hour the ship would hoist her sails and be off.\n",
      "\"You've the wind right against you, and must use oars. No time to lose.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They ran to some steps leading down to the water. They beckoned to some watermen, who, suspecting\n",
      "the real state of the case, appeared in no hurry for a fare, but leisurely brought their boat\n",
      "alongside the stairs, as if it were a matter of indifference to them whether they were engaged or\n",
      "not, while they conversed together in few words, and in an under-tone, respecting the charge they\n",
      "should make.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, pray make haste,\" called Mary. \"I want you to take me to the <hi>John Cropper</hi>. Where is\n",
      "she, Charley? Tell them—I don't rightly know the words,—only make haste!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"In the offing she is, sure enough, miss,\" answered one of the men, shoving Charley on one side,\n",
      "regarding him as too young to be a principal in the bargain.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't think we can go, Dick,\" said he, with a wink to his companion; \"there's the gentleman\n",
      "over at New Brighton as wants us.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But, mayhap, the young woman will pay us handsome for giving her a last look at her sweetheart,\"\n",
      "interposed the other.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, how much do you want? Only make haste—I've enough to pay you, but every moment is precious,\"\n",
      "said Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, that it is. Less than an hour won't take us to the mouth of the river, and she'll be off by\n",
      "two o'clock!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Poor Mary's ideas of \"plenty of money,\" however, were different to those entertained by the\n",
      "boatmen. Only fourteen or fifteen shillings remained out of the sovereign Margaret had lent her, and\n",
      "the boatmen, imagining \"plenty\" to mean no less than several pounds, insisted upon receiving a\n",
      "sovereign (an exorbitant fare, by the bye, although reduced from their first demand of thirty\n",
      "shillings).</p>\n",
      "<p>While Charley, with a boy's impatience of delay, and disregard of money, kept urging,</p>\n",

      "\"but I'll give you my shawl, and you can sell it for four or five shillings,—oh! won't that much\n",
      "do?\" asked she, in such a tone of voice, that they must indeed have had hard hearts who could refuse\n",
      "such agonised entreaty.</p>\n",

      "<p>They had been rowing a long, long time—half a day it seemed, at least—yet Liverpool appeared\n",

      "<p>Mary stood up, steadying herself by the mast, and stretched out her arms, imploring the flying\n",

      "<p>Her throat was dry; all musical sound had gone out of her voice; but in a loud harsh whisper she\n",

      "<p>\"We're come for one William Wilson, who is wanted to prove an <hi>alibi</hi> in Liverpool Assize\n",
      "Courts to-morrow. James Wilson is to be tried for a murder, done on Thursday night, when he was with\n",
      "William Wilson. Any thing more, missis?\" asked the boat-man of Mary, in a lower voice, and taking\n",

      "<p>\"Say I'm Mary Barton. Oh, the ship is going on! Oh, for the love of Heaven, ask them to\n",

      "oaths.</p>\n",
      "<p>The ship flew along—away,—the boat struggled after.</p>\n",
      "<p>They could see the captain take his speaking-trumpet. And oh! and alas! they heard his words.</p>\n",

      "who prays in the death-agony. For her eyes were turned up to that Heaven, where mercy dwelleth,\n",
      "while her blue lips quivered, though no sound came. Then she bowed her head and hid it in her\n",

      "<p>She looked up. And her heart stopped its beating to listen.</p>\n",

      "the innocent.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What does he say?\" asked Mary wildly, as the voice died away in the increasing distance, while\n",
      "the boatmen cheered, in their kindled sympathy with their passenger.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What does he say?\" repeated she. \"Tell me. I could not hear.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She had heard with her ears, but her brain refused to recognise the sense.</p>\n",
      "<p>They repeated his speech, all three speaking at once, with many comments; while Mary looked at\n",
      "them and then at the vessel now far away.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't rightly know about it,\" said she, sorrowfully. \"What is the pilot-boat?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They told her, and she gathered the meaning out of the sailors' slang which enveloped it. There\n",
      "was a hope still, although so slight and faint.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How far does the pilot go with the ship?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>To different distances they said. Some pilots would go as far as Holyhead for the chance of the\n",
      "homeward-bound vessels; others only took the ships over the Banks. Some captains were more cautious\n",
      "than others, and the pilots had different ways. The wind was against the homeward bound vessels, so\n",
      "perhaps the pilot aboard the <hi>John Cropper</hi> would not care to go far out.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How soon would he come back?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There were three boatmen, and three opinions, varying from twelve hours to two days. Nay, the man\n",
      "who gave his vote for the longest time, on having his judgment disputed, grew stubborn, and doubled\n",
      "the time, and thought it might be the end of the week before the pilot-boat came home.</p>\n",
      "<p>They began disputing, and urging reasons; and Mary tried to understand them; but independently of\n",
      "their nautical language, a veil seemed drawn over her mind, and she had no clear perception of any\n",
      "thing that passed. Her very words seemed not her own, and beyond her power of control, for she found\n",
      "herself speaking quite differently to what she meant.</p>\n",
      "<p>One by one her hopes had fallen away, and left her desolate; and though a chance yet remained,\n",
      "she could no longer hope. She felt certain it, too, would fade and vanish. She sank into a kind of\n",
      "stupor. All outward objects harmonised with her despair.</p>\n",
      "<p>The gloomy leaden sky,—the deep, dark waters below, of a still heavier shade of colour,—the cold,\n",
      "flat yellow shore in the distance, which no ray lightened up,—the nipping, cutting wind.</p>\n",
      "<p>She shivered with her depression of mind and body.</p>\n",
      "<p>The sails were taken down, of course, on the return to Liverpool, and the progress they made,\n",
      "rowing and tacking, was very slow. The men talked together, disputing about the pilots at first, and\n",
      "then about matters of local importance, in which Mary would have taken no interest at any time, and\n",
      "she gradually became drowsy; irrepressibly so, indeed, for in spite of her jerking efforts to keep\n",
      "awake she sank away to the bottom of the boat, and there lay couched on a rough heap of sails, rope,\n",
      "and tackle of various kinds.</p>\n",
      "<p>The measured beat of the waters against the sides of the boat, and the musical boom of the more\n",
      "distant waves, were more lulling than silence, and she slept sound.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once she opened her eyes heavily, and dimly saw the old gray, rough boatman (who had stood out\n",
      "the most obstinately for the full fare) covering her with his thick pea-jacket. He had taken it off\n",
      "on purpose, and was doing it tenderly in his way, but before she could rouse herself up to thank him\n",
      "she had dropped off to sleep again.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last, in the dusk of evening, they arrived at the landing-place from which they had started\n",
      "some hours before. The men spoke to Mary, but though she mechanically replied, she did not stir; so,\n",
      "at length, they were obliged to shake her. She stood up, shivering and puzzled as to her\n",
      "whereabouts.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Now tell me where you are bound to, missis,\" said the gray old man, \"and maybe I can put you in\n",
      "the way.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She slowly comprehended what he said, and went through the process of recollection; but very\n",
      "dimly, and with much labour. She put her hand into her pocket and pulled out her purse, and shook\n",
      "its contents into the man's hand; and then began meekly to unpin her shawl, although they had turned\n",
      "away without asking for it.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, no!\" said the older man, who lingered on the step before springing into the boat, and to\n",
      "whom she mutely offered the shawl.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Keep it! we donnot want it. It were only for to try you,—some folks say they've no more blunt,\n",
      "when all the while they've getten a mint.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thank you,\" said she, in a dull, low tone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where are you bound to? I axed that question afore,\" said the gruff old fellow.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't know. I'm a stranger,\" replied she, quietly, with a strange absence of anxiety under the\n",
      "circumstances.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But you mun find out then,\" said he, sharply, \"pier-head's no place for a young woman to be\n",
      "standing on, gape-saying.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I've a card somewhere as will tell me,\" she answered, and the man, partly relieved, jumped into\n",
      "the boat, which was now pushing off to make way for the arrivals from some steamer.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary felt in her pocket for the card, on which was written the name of the street where she was\n",
      "to have met Mr. Bridgenorth at two o'clock; where Job and Mrs. Wilson were to have been, and where\n",
      "she was to have learnt from the former the particulars of some respectable lodging. It was not to be\n",
      "found.</p>\n",
      "<p>She tried to brighten her perceptions, and felt again, and took out the little articles her\n",
      "pocket contained, her empty purse, her pocket-handkerchief, and such little things, but it was not\n",
      "there.</p>\n",
      "<p>In fact she had dropped it when, so eager to embark, she had pulled out her purse to reckon up\n",
      "her money.</p>\n",
      "<p>She did not know this, of course. She only knew it was gone.</p>\n",
      "<p>It added but little to the despair that was creeping over her. But she tried a little more to\n",
      "help herself, though every minute her mind became more cloudy. She strove to remember where Will had\n",
      "lodged, but she could not; name, street, every thing had passed away, and it did not signify; better\n",
      "she were lost than found.</p>\n",
      "<p>She sat down quietly on the top step of the landing, and gazed down into the dark, dank water\n",
      "below. Once or twice a spectral thought loomed among the shadows of her brain; a wonder whether\n",
      "beneath that cold dismal surface there would not be rest from the troubles of earth. But she could\n",
      "not hold an idea before her for two consecutive moments; and she forgot what she thought about\n",
      "before she could act upon it.</p>\n",
      "<p>So she continued sitting motionless, without looking up, or regarding in any way the insults to\n",
      "which she was subjected.</p>\n",
      "<p>Through the darkening light the old boatman had watched her: interested in her in spite of\n",
      "himself, and his scoldings of himself.</p>\n",
      "<p>When the landing-place was once more comparatively clear, he made his way towards it, across\n",
      "boats, and along planks, swearing at himself while he did so, for an old fool.</p>\n",
      "<p>He shook Mary's shoulder violently.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"D—— you, I ask you again where you're bound to? Don't sit there, stupid. Where are you going\n",
      "to?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't know,\" sighed Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come, come; avast with that story. You said a bit ago you'd a card, which was to tell you where\n",
      "to go.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I had, but I've lost it. Never mind.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She looked again down upon the black mirror below.</p>\n",
      "<p>He stood by her, striving to put down his better self; but he could not. He shook her again. She\n",
      "looked up, as if she had forgotten him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What do you want?\" asked she, wearily.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Come with me, and be d——d to you!\" replied he, clutching her arm to pull her up.</p>\n",

      "<p>At five minutes before two, Job Legh stood upon the door-step of the house where Mr. Bridgenorth\n",
      "lodged at Assize time. He had left Mrs. Wilson at the dwelling of a friend of his, who had offered\n",

      "<p>He was shown in to Mr. Bridgenorth, who was writing. Mary and Will Wilson had not yet arrived,\n",

      "Mr. Bridgenorth's interview that morning with Jem.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, yes,\" said Mr. Bridgenorth, putting down his pen, \"I have seen him, but to little purpose,\n",
      "I'm afraid. He's very impracticable—very. I told him, of course, that he must be perfectly open with\n",
      "me, or else I could not be prepared for the weak points. I named your name with the view of\n",
      "unlocking his confidence, but—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What did he say?\" asked Job, breathlessly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, very little. He barely answered me. Indeed, he refused to answer some questions—positively\n",
      "refused. I don't know what I can do for him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then you think him guilty, sir?\" said Job, despondingly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, I don't,\" replied Mr. Bridgenorth, quickly and decisively. \"Much less than I did before I\n",
      "saw him. The impression (mind, 'tis only impression; I rely upon your caution, not to take it for\n",
      "fact)—the impression,\" with an emphasis on the word, \"he gave me is, that he knows something about\n",
      "the affair, but what, he will not say; and so the chances are, if he persists in his obstinacy,\n",
      "he'll be hung. That's all.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He began to write again, for he had no time to lose.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But he must not be hung,\" said Job, with vehemence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Bridgenorth looked up, smiled a little, but shook his head.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What did he say, sir, if I may be so bold as to ask?\" continued Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"His words were few enough, and he was so reserved and short, that as I said before, I can only\n",
      "give you the impression they conveyed to me. I told him of course who I was, and for what I was\n",
      "sent. He looked pleased, I thought,—at least his face (sad enough when I went in, I assure ye)\n",
      "brightened a little; but he said he had nothing to say, no defence to make. I asked him if he was\n",
      "guilty, then; and by way of opening his heart I said I understood he had had provocation enough,\n",
      "inasmuch as I heard that the girl was very lovely, and had jilted him to fall desperately in love\n",
      "with that handsome young Carson (poor fellow!). But James Wilson did not speak one way or another. I\n",
      "then went to particulars. I asked him if the gun was his, as his mother had declared. He had not\n",
      "heard of her admission it was evident, from his quick way of looking up, and the glance of his eye;\n",
      "but when he saw I was observing him, he hung down his head again, and merely said she was right; it\n",
      "was his gun.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well!\" said Job, impatiently, as Mr. Bridgenorth paused.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay! I have little more to tell you,\" continued that gentleman. \"I asked him to inform me in all\n",
      "confidence, how it came to be found there. He was silent for a time, and then refused. Not only\n",
      "refused to answer that question, but candidly told me he would not say another word on the subject,\n",
      "and, thanking me for my trouble and interest in his behalf, he all but dismissed me. Ungracious\n",
      "enough on the whole, was it not, Mr. Legh? And yet, I assure ye, I am twenty times more inclined to\n",
      "think him innocent than before I had the interview.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I wish Mary Barton would come,\" said Job, anxiously. \"She and Will are a long time about\n",
      "it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, that's our only chance, I believe,\" answered Mr. Bridgenorth, who was writing again. \"I sent\n",
      "Johnson off before twelve to serve him with his sub-pœna, and to say I wanted to speak with him;\n",
      "he'll be here soon, I've no doubt.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a pause. Mr. Bridgenorth looked up again, and spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mr. Duncombe promised to be here to speak to his character. I sent him a subpœna on Saturday\n",
      "night. Though after all, juries go very little by such general and vague testimony as that to\n",

      "we must rest our case on the <hi>alibi</hi>.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The pen went again, scratch, scratch over the paper.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job grew very fidgetty. He sat on the edge of his chair, the more readily to start up when Will\n",
      "and Mary should appear. He listened intently to every noise and every step on the stair.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once he heard a man's footstep, and his old heart gave a leap of delight. But it was only Mr.\n",
      "Bridgenorth's clerk, bringing him a list of those cases in which the grand jury had found true\n",
      "bills. He glanced it over and pushed it to Job, merely saying,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Of course we expected this,\" and went on with his writing.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a true bill against James Wilson. Of course. And yet Job felt now doubly anxious and\n",
      "sad. It seemed the beginning of the end. He had got, by imperceptible degrees, to think Jem\n",
      "innocent. Little by little this persuasion had come upon him.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary (tossing about in the little boat on the broad river) did not come, nor did Will.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job grew very restless. He longed to go and watch for them out of the window, but feared to\n",
      "interrupt Mr. Bridgenorth. At length his desire to look out was irresistible, and he got up and\n",
      "walked carefully and gently across the room, his boots creaking at every cautious step. The gloom\n",
      "which had overspread the sky, and the influence of which had been felt by Mary on the open water,\n",
      "was yet more perceptible in the dark, dull street. Job grew more and more fidgetty. He was obliged\n",
      "to walk about the room, for he could not keep still; and he did so, regardless of Mr. Bridgenorth's\n",
      "impatient little motions and noises, as the slow, stealthy, creaking movements were heard, backwards\n",
      "and forwards, behind his chair.</p>\n",
      "<p>He really liked Job, and was interested for Jem, else his nervousness would have overcome his\n",
      "sympathy long before it did. But he could hold out no longer against the monotonous, grating sound;\n",
      "so at last he threw down his pen, locked his portfolio, and taking up his hat and gloves, he told\n",
      "Job he must go to the courts.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But Will Wilson is not come,\" said Job, in dismay. \"Just wait while I run to his lodgings. I\n",
      "would have done it before, but I thought they'd be here every minute, and I were afraid of missing\n",
      "them. I'll be back in no time.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, my good fellow, I really must go. Besides, I begin to think Johnson must have made a\n",
      "mistake, and have fixed with this William Wilson to meet me at the courts. If you like to wait for\n",
      "him here, pray make use of my room; but I've a notion I shall find him there: in which case, I'll\n",
      "send him to your lodgings; shall I? You know where to find me. I shall be here again by eight\n",
      "o'clock, and with the evidence of this witness that's to prove the <hi>alibi</hi>, I'll have the\n",
      "brief drawn out, and in the hands of counsel to-night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So saying he shook hands with Job, and went his way. The old man considered for a minute as he\n",
      "lingered at the door, and then bent his steps towards Mrs. Jones's, where he knew (from reference to\n",
      "queer, odd, heterogeneous memoranda, in an ancient black-leather pocket-book) that Will lodged, and\n",
      "where he doubted not he should hear both of him and of Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>He went there, and gathered what intelligence he could out of Mrs. Jones's slow replies.</p>\n",
      "<p>He asked if a young woman had been there that morning, and if she had seen Will Wilson. \"No!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why not?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, bless you, 'cause he had sailed some hours before she came asking for him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a dead silence, broken only by the even, heavy sound of Mrs. Jones's ironing.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where is the young woman now?\" asked Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Somewhere down at the docks,\" she thought. \"Charley would know, if he was in, but he wasn't. He\n",
      "was in mischief, somewhere or other, she had no doubt. Boys always were. He would break his neck\n",
      "some day, she knew;\" so saying, she quietly spat upon her fresh iron, to test its heat, and then\n",
      "went on with her business.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job could have boxed her, he was in such a state of irritation. But he did not, and he had his\n",
      "reward. Charley came in, whistling with an air of indifference, assumed to carry off his knowledge\n",
      "of the lateness of the hour to which he had lingered about the docks.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Here's an old man come to know where the young woman is who went out with thee this morning,\"\n",
      "said his mother, after she had bestowed on him a little motherly scolding.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where she is now, I don't know. I saw her last sailing down the river after the <hi>John\n",
      "Cropper</hi>. I'm afeared she won't reach her; wind changed and she would be under weigh, and over\n",
      "the bar in no time. She should have been back by now.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It took Job some little time to understand this, from the confused use of the feminine pronoun.\n",
      "Then he inquired how he could best find Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'll run down again to the pier,\" said the boy; \"I'll warrant I'll find her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou shalt do no such a thing,\" said his mother, setting her back against the door. The lad made\n",
      "a comical face at Job, which met with no responsive look from the old man, whose sympathies were\n",
      "naturally in favour of the parent; although he would thankfully have availed himself of Charley's\n",
      "offer, for he was weary, and anxious to return to poor Mrs. Wilson, who would be wondering what had\n",
      "become of him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"How can I best find her? Who did she go with, lad?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But Charley was sullen at his mother's exercise of authority before a stranger, and at that\n",
      "stranger's grave looks when he meant to have made him laugh.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They were river boatmen;—that's all I know,\" said he.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But what was the name of their boat?\" persevered Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I never took no notice;—the Anne, or William,—or some of them common names, I'll be bound.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What pier did she start from?\" asked Job, despairingly.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, as for that matter, it were the stairs on the Prince's Pier she started from; but she'll not\n",
      "come back to the same, for the American steamer came up with the tide, and anchored close to it,\n",
      "blocking up the way for all the smaller craft. It's a rough evening too, to be out on,\" he\n",
      "maliciously added.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, God's will be done! I did hope we could have saved the lad,\" said Job, sorrowfully; \"but\n",
      "I'm getten very doubtful again. I'm uneasy about Mary, too,—very. She's a stranger in\n",
      "Liverpool.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So she told me,\" said Charley. \"There's traps about for young women at every corner. It's a pity\n",
      "she's no one to meet her when she lands.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"As for that,\" replied Job, \"I don't see how any one could meet her when we can't tell where she\n",
      "would come to. I must trust to her coming right. She's getten spirit and sense. She'll most likely\n",
      "be for coming here again. Indeed, I don't know what else she can do, for she knows no other place in\n",
      "Liverpool. Missus, if she comes, will you give your son leave to bring her to No. 8, Back Garden\n",
      "Court, where there's friends waiting for her? I'll give him sixpence for his trouble.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Jones, pleased with the reference to her, gladly promised. And even Charley, indignant as he\n",
      "was at first at the idea of his motions being under the control of his mother, was mollified at the\n",
      "prospect of the sixpence, and at the probability of getting nearer to the heart of the mystery.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"It's a bad job,\" said the lawyer, looking very grave, while he arranged his papers. \"Johnson\n",
      "told me how it was; the woman that Wilson lodged with told him. I doubt it's but a wild-goose chase\n",
      "of the girl Barton. Our case must rest on the uncertainty of circumstantial evidence, and the\n",
      "goodness of the prisoner's previous character. A very vague and weak defence. However, I've engaged\n",

      "<p>After this Job could not stay, and, making his humble bow, he left the room.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then he went to Mrs. Jones's. She was in, but Charley had slipped off again. There was no holding\n",
      "that boy. Nothing kept him but lock and key, and they did not always; for once she had him locked up\n",
      "in the garret, and he had got off through the skylight. Perhaps now he was gone to see after the\n",

      "<p>Mrs. Jones ironed and folded her clothes, talking all the time of Charley and her husband, who\n",
      "was a sailor in some ship bound for India, and who, in leaving her their boy, had evidently left her\n",
      "rather more than she could manage. She moaned and croaked over sailors, and sea-port towns, and\n",
      "stormy weather, and sleepless nights, and trousers all over tar and pitch, long after Job had left\n",
      "off attending to her, and was only trying to hearken to every step and every voice in the\n",
      "street.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last Charley came in, but he came alone.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yon Mary Barton has getten into some scrape or another,\" said he, addressing himself to Job.\n",
      "\"She's not to be heard of at any of the piers; and Bourne says it were a boat from the Cheshire side\n",
      "as she went aboard of. So there's no hearing of her till to-morrow morning.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To-morrow morning she'll have to be in court at nine o'clock, to bear witness on a trial,\" said\n",
      "Job, sorrowfully.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So she said; at least somewhat of the kind,\" said Charley, looking desirous to hear more. But\n",
      "Job was silent.</p>\n",
      "<p>He could not think of any thing further that could be done; so he rose up, and, thanking Mrs.\n",
      "Jones for the shelter she had given him, he went out into the street; and there he stood still, to\n",
      "ponder over probabilities and chances.</p>\n",
      "<p>After some little time he slowly turned towards the lodging where he had left Mrs. Wilson. There\n",
      "was nothing else to be done; but he loitered on the way, fervently hoping that her weariness and her\n",
      "woes might have sent her to sleep before his return, that he might be spared her questionings.</p>\n",
      "<p>He went very gently into the house-place where the sleepy landlady awaited his coming and his\n",
      "bringing the girl, who, she had been told, was to share the old woman's bed.</p>\n",
      "<p>But in her sleepy blindness she knocked things so about in lighting the candle (she could see to\n",
      "have a nap by fire-light, she said), that the voice of Mrs. Wilson was heard from the little\n",

      "<p>\"Who's there?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job gave no answer, and kept down his breath, that she might think herself mistaken. The\n",
      "landlady, having no such care, dropped the snuffers with a sharp metallic sound, and then, by her\n",
      "endless apologies, convinced the listening woman that Job had returned.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Job! Job Legh!\" she cried out, nervously.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Eh, dear!\" said Job to himself, going reluctantly to her bed-room door. \"I wonder if one little\n",
      "lie would be a sin as things stand? It would happen give her sleep, and she won't have sleep for\n",
      "many and many a night (not to call sleep), if things goes wrong to-morrow. I'll chance it, any\n",
      "way.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Job! art thou there?\" asked she again with a trembling impatience that told in every tone of her\n",

      "<p>\"Ay! sure! I thought thou'd ha' been asleep by this time.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Asleep! How could I sleep till I knowed if Will were found?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Now for it,\" muttered Job to himself. Then in a louder voice, \"Never fear! he's found, and safe,\n",
      "ready for to-morrow.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And he'll prove that thing for my poor lad, will he? He'll bear witness that Jem were with him?\n",
      "Oh, Job, speak! tell me all!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"In for a penny, in for a pound,\" thought Job. \"Happen one prayer will do for the sum total. Any\n",
      "rate, I must go on now.—Ay, ay,\" shouted he, through the door. \"He can prove all; and Jem will come\n",
      "off as clear as a new-born babe.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He could hear Mrs. Wilson's rustling movements, and in an instant guessed she was on her knees,\n",
      "for he heard her trembling voice uplifted in thanksgiving and praise to God, stopped at times by\n",
      "sobs of gladness and relief.</p>\n",
      "<p>And when he heard this, his heart misgave him; for he thought of the awful enlightening, the\n",
      "terrible revulsion of feeling that awaited her in the morning. He saw the short-sightedness of\n",
      "falsehood; but what could he do now?</p>\n",
      "<p>While he listened, she ended her grateful prayers.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And Mary? Thou'st found her at Mrs. Jones's, Job?\" said she, continuing her inquiries.</p>\n",
      "<p>He gave a great sigh.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, she was there, safe enough, second time of going.—God forgive me!\" muttered he, \"who'd ha'\n",
      "thought of my turning out such an arrant liar in my old days?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Bless the wench! Is she here? Why does she not come to bed? I'm sure she's need.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job coughed away his remains of conscience, and made answer,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She was a bit weary, and o'er done with her sail; and Mrs. Jones axed her to stay there all\n",
      "night. It was nigh at hand to the courts, where she will have to be in the morning.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It comes easy enough after a while,\" groaned out Job. \"The father of lies helps one, I suppose,\n",
      "for now my speech comes as natural as truth. She's done questioning now, that's one good thing. I'll\n",
      "be off before Satan and she are at me again.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He went to the house-place, where the landlady stood wearily waiting. Her husband was in bed, and\n",
      "asleep long ago.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Job had not yet made up his mind what to do. He could not go to sleep, with all his\n",

      "on which the mother's eyes caught, and gazed until they filled with tears. But she brushed the drops\n",

      "aired.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I cannot sleep, thank you. I will sit here, if you please,\" said Mary, sinking down on the\n",

      "<p>\"Come, now,\" said Mrs. Sturgis, \"my master told me to see you to bed, and I mun. What's the use\n",
      "of watching? A watched pot never boils, and I see you are after watching that weather-cock. Why now,\n",
      "I try never to look at it, else I could do nought else. My heart many a time goes sick when the wind\n",

      "<p>The circumstances of the murder, the discovery of the body, the causes of suspicion against Jem,\n",

      "<p>\"Well, I am no physiognomist, but I don't think his face strikes me as bad. It certainly is\n",
      "gloomy and depressed, and not unnaturally so, considering his situation.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Only look at his low, resolute brow, his downcast eye, his white compressed lips. He never looks\n",
      "up,—just watch him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"His forehead is not so low if he had that mass of black hair removed, and is very square, which\n",
      "some people say is a good sign. If others are to be influenced by such trifles as you are, it would\n",
      "have been much better if the prison barber had cut his hair a little previous to the trial; and as\n",

      "did not lose the time of the court in listening to any thing unnecessary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Clear as day against the prisoner,\" whispered one attorney's clerk to another.</p>\n",

      "appearance was so much beyond her years, which might not be many above fifty. But partly owing to\n",
      "her accident in early life, which left a stamp of pain upon her face, partly owing to her anxious\n",
      "temper, partly to her sorrows, and partly to her limping gait, she always gave me the idea of age.\n",
      "But now she might have seemed more than seventy; her lines were so set and deep, her features so\n",
      "sharpened, and her walk so feeble. She was trying to check her sobs into composure, and\n",
      "(unconsciously) was striving to behave as she thought would best please her poor boy, whom she knew\n",
      "she had often grieved by her uncontrolled impatience. He had buried his face in his arms, which\n",
      "rested on the front of the dock (an attitude he retained during the greater part of his trial, and\n",
      "which prejudiced many against him).</p>\n",
      "<p>The counsel began the examination.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Your name is Jane Wilson, I believe.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"The mother of the prisoner at the bar?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, sir;\" with quivering voice, ready to break out into weeping, but earning respect by the\n",
      "strong effort at self-control, prompted, as I have said before, by her earnest wish to please her\n",
      "son by her behaviour.</p>\n",
      "<p>The barrister now proceeded to the important part of the examination, tending to prove that the\n",
      "gun found on the scene of the murder was the prisoner's. She had committed herself so fully to the\n",
      "policeman, that she could not well retract; so without much delay in bringing the question round to\n",
      "the desired point, the gun was produced in court, and the inquiry made—</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That gun belongs to your son, does it not?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She clenched the sides of the witness-box in her efforts to make her parched tongue utter words.\n",
      "At last she moaned forth,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! Jem, Jem! what mun I say?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Every one bent forward to hear the prisoner's answer; although, in fact, it was of little\n",
      "importance to the issue of the trial. He lifted up his head; and with a face brimming full of pity\n",
      "for his mother, yet resolved into endurance, said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tell the truth, mother!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And so she did, with the fidelity of a little child. Every one felt that she did; and the little\n",
      "colloquy between mother and son did them some slight service in the opinion of the audience. But the\n",
      "awful judge sat unmoved; and the jurymen changed not a muscle of their countenances; while the\n",
      "counsel for the prosecution went triumphantly through this part of the case, including the fact of\n",
      "Jem's absence from home on the night of the murder, and bringing every admission to bear right\n",
      "against the prisoner.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was over. She was told to go down. But she could no longer compel her mother's heart to keep\n",
      "silence, and suddenly turning towards the judge (with whom she imagined the verdict to rest), she\n",
      "thus addressed him with her choking voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And now, sir, I've telled you the truth, and the whole truth, as <hi>he</hi> bid me; but don't\n",
      "ye let what I have said go for to hang him; oh, my lord judge, take my word for it, he's as innocent\n",
      "as the child as has yet to be born. For sure, I, who am his mother, and have nursed him on my knee,\n",
      "and been gladdened by the sight of him every day since, ought to know him better than yon pack of\n",
      "fellows\" (indicating the jury, while she strove against her heart to render her words distinct and\n",
      "clear for her dear son's sake) \"who, I'll go bail, never saw him before this morning in all their\n",
      "born days. My lord judge, he's so good I often wondered what harm there was in him; many is the time\n",
      "when I've been fretted (for I'm frabbit enough at times), when I've scold't myself, and said, 'You\n",
      "ungrateful thing, the Lord God has given you Jem, and isn't that blessing enough for you?' But He\n",
      "has seen fit to punish me. If Jem is—if Jem is—taken from me, I shall be a childless woman; and very\n",
      "poor, having nought left to love on earth, and I cannot say 'His will be done.' I cannot, my lord\n",
      "judge, oh, I cannot.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>While sobbing out these words she was led away by the officers of the court, but tenderly, and\n",
      "reverently, with the respect which great sorrow commands.</p>\n",
      "<p>The stream of evidence went on and on, gathering fresh force from every witness who was examined,\n",
      "and threatening to overwhelm poor Jem. Already they had proved that the gun was his, that he had\n",
      "been heard not many days before the commission of the deed to threaten the deceased; indeed, that\n",
      "the police had, at that time, been obliged to interfere to prevent some probable act of violence. It\n",
      "only remained to bring forward a sufficient motive for the threat and the murder. The clue to this\n",
      "had been furnished by the policeman, who had overheard Jem's angry language to Mr. Carson; and his\n",
      "report in the first instance had occasioned the subpœna to Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>And now she was to be called on to bear witness. The court was by this time almost as full as it\n",
      "could hold; but fresh attempts were being made to squeeze in at all the entrances, for many were\n",
      "anxious to see and hear this part of the trial.</p>\n",
      "<p>Old Mr. Carson felt an additional beat at his heart at the thought of seeing the fatal Helen, the\n",
      "cause of all—a kind of interest and yet repugnance, for was not she beloved by the dead; nay,\n",
      "perhaps in her way, loving and mourning for the same being that he himself was so bitterly grieving\n",
      "over? And yet he felt as if he abhorred her and her rumoured loveliness, as if she were the curse\n",
      "against him; and he grew jealous of the love with which she had inspired his son, and would fain\n",
      "have deprived her of even her natural right of sorrowing over her lover's untimely end: for you see\n",
      "it was a fixed idea in the minds of all, that the handsome, bright, gay, rich young gentleman must\n",
      "have been beloved in preference to the serious, almost stern-looking smith, who had to toil for his\n",
      "daily bread.</p>\n",
      "<p>Hitherto the effect of the trial had equalled Mr. Carson's most sanguine hopes, and a severe look\n",
      "of satisfaction came over the face of the avenger,—over that countenance whence the smile had\n",
      "departed, never more to return.</p>\n",
      "<p>All eyes were directed to the door through which the witnesses entered. Even Jem looked up to\n",
      "catch one glimpse before he hid his face from her look of aversion. The officer had gone to fetch\n",
      "her.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was in exactly the same attitude as when Job Legh had seen her two hours before through the\n",
      "half-open door. Not a finger had moved. The officer summoned her, but she did not stir. She was so\n",
      "still he thought she had fallen asleep, and he stepped forward and touched her. She started up in an\n",
      "instant, and followed him with a kind of rushing rapid motion into the court, into the\n",
      "witness-box.</p>\n",
      "<p>And amid all that sea of faces, misty and swimming before her eyes, she saw but two clear bright\n",
      "spots, distinct and fixed: the judge, who might have to condemn; and the prisoner, who might have to\n",
      "die.</p>\n",
      "<p>The mellow sunlight streamed down that high window on her head, and fell on the rich treasure of\n",
      "her golden hair, stuffed away in masses under her little bonnet-cap; and in those warm beams the\n",
      "motes kept dancing up and down. The wind had changed—had changed almost as soon as she had given up\n",
      "her watching; the wind had changed, and she heeded it not.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many who were looking for mere flesh and blood beauty, mere colouring, were disappointed; for her\n",
      "face was deadly white, and almost set in its expression, while a mournful bewildered soul looked out\n",
      "of the depths of those soft, deep, gray eyes. But others recognised a higher and stranger kind of\n",
      "beauty; one that would keep its hold on the memory for many after years.</p>\n",
      "<p>I was not there myself; but one who was, told me that her look, and indeed her whole face, was\n",
      "more like the well-known engraving from Guido's picture of \"Beatrice Cenci\" than any thing else he\n",
      "could give me an idea of. He added, that her countenance haunted him, like the remembrance of some\n",
      "wild sad melody, heard in childhood; that it would perpetually recur with its mute imploring\n",
      "agony.</p>\n",
      "<p>With all the court reeling before her (always save and except those awful two), she heard a voice\n",
      "speak, and answered the simple inquiry (something about her name) mechanically, as if in a dream. So\n",
      "she went on for two or three more questions, with a strange wonder in her brain, as to the reality\n",
      "of the terrible circumstances in which she was placed.</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly she was roused, she knew not how or by what. She was conscious that all was real, that\n",
      "hundreds were looking at her, that true-sounding words were being extracted from her; that that\n",
      "figure, so bowed down, with the face concealed by both hands, was really Jem. Her face flushed\n",
      "scarlet, and then paler than before. But in her dread of herself, with the tremendous secret\n",
      "imprisoned within her, she exerted every power she had to keep in the full understanding of what was\n",
      "going on, of what she was asked, and of what she answered. With all her faculties preternaturally\n",
      "alive and sensitive, she heard the next question from the pert young barrister, who was delighted to\n",
      "have the examination of this witness.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And pray, may I ask, which was the favoured lover? You say you knew both these young men. Which\n",
      "was the favoured lover? Which did you prefer?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And who was he, the questioner, that he should dare so lightly to ask of her heart's secrets?\n",
      "That he should dare to ask her to tell, before that multitude assembled there, what woman usually\n",
      "whispers with blushes and tears, and many hesitations, to one ear alone?</p>\n",
      "<p>So, for an instant, a look of indignation contracted Mary's brow, as she steadily met the eyes of\n",
      "the impertinent counsellor. But, in that instant, she saw the hands removed from a face beyond,\n",
      "behind; and a countenance revealed of such intense love and woe,—such a deprecating dread of her\n",
      "answer; and suddenly her resolution was taken. The present was everything; the future, that vast\n",
      "shroud, it was maddening to think upon; but <hi>now</hi> she might own her fault, but <hi>now</hi>\n",
      "she might even own her love. Now, when the beloved stood thus, abhorred of men, there would be no\n",
      "feminine shame to stand between her and her avowal. So she also turned towards the judge, partly to\n",
      "mark that her answer was not given to the monkeyfied man who questioned her, and likewise that her\n",
      "face might be averted from, and her eyes not gaze upon, the form that contracted with the dread of\n",
      "the words he anticipated.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He asks me which of them two I liked the best. Perhaps I liked Mr. Harry Carson once—I don't\n",
      "know—I've forgotten; but I loved James Wilson, that's now on trial, above what tongue can tell—above\n",
      "all else on earth put together; and I love him now better than ever, though he has never known a\n",
      "word of it till this minute. For you see, sir, mother died before I was thirteen, before I could\n",
      "know right from wrong about some things; and I was giddy and vain, and ready to listen to any praise\n",
      "of my good looks; and this poor young Mr. Carson fell in with me, and told me he loved me; and I was\n",
      "foolish enough to think he meant me marriage: a mother is a pitiful loss to a girl, sir; and so I\n",
      "used to fancy I could like to be a lady, and rich, and never know want any more. I never found out\n",
      "how dearly I loved another till one day, when James Wilson asked me to marry him, and I was very\n",
      "hard and sharp in my answer (for indeed, sir, I'd a deal to bear just then), and he took me at my\n",
      "word and left me; and from that day to this I've never spoken a word to him, or set eyes on him;\n",
      "though I'd fain have done so, to try and show him we had both been too hasty; for he'd not been gone\n",
      "out of my sight above a minute before I knew I loved—far above my life,\" said she, dropping her\n",
      "voice as she came to this second confession of the strength of her attachment. \"But, if the\n",
      "gentleman asks me which I loved the best, I make answer, I was flattered by Mr. Carson, and pleased\n",
      "with his flattery; but James Wilson I—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She covered her face with her hands, to hide the burning scarlet blushes, which even dyed her\n",
      "fingers.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a little pause; still, though her speech might inspire pity for the prisoner, it only\n",
      "strengthened the supposition of his guilt. Presently the counsellor went on with his\n",
      "examination.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But you have seen young Mr. Carson since your rejection of the prisoner?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, often.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You have spoken to him, I conclude, at these times.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Only once to call speaking.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And what was the substance of your conversation? Did you tell him you found you preferred his\n",
      "rival?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, sir. I don't think as I've done wrong in saying, now as things stand, what my feelings are;\n",
      "but I never would be so bold as to tell one young man I cared for another. I never named Jem's name\n",
      "to Mr. Carson. Never.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then what did you say when you had this final conversation with Mr. Carson? You can give me the\n",

      "jealousy by boasting of a lover so far above you in station?\"</p>\n",

      "There was no occasion to detain her longer; she had done her part. She might go down. The evidence\n",

      "attitude, and a look of determination on his face, which almost made it appear noble. Yet he seemed\n",
      "lost in thought.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job Legh had all this time been trying to soothe and comfort Mrs. Wilson, who would first be in\n",
      "the court, in order to see her darling, and then, when her sobs became irrepressible, had to be led\n",
      "out into the open air, and sat there weeping, on the steps of the court-house. Who would have taken\n",
      "charge of Mary on her release from the witness-box I do not know, if Mrs. Sturgis, the boatman's\n",
      "wife, had not been there, brought by her interest in Mary, towards whom she now pressed, in order to\n",
      "urge her to leave the scene of the trial.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No! no!\" said Mary, to this proposition. \"I must be here, I must watch that they don't hang him,\n",

      "<p>\"Oh! they'll not hang him! never fear! Besides the wind has changed, and that's in his favour.\n",
      "Come away. You're so hot, and first white and then red; I'm sure you're ill. Just come away.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! I don't know about any thing but that I must stay,\" replied Mary, in a strange hurried\n",
      "manner, catching hold of some rails as if she feared some bodily force would be employed to remove\n",
      "her. So Mrs. Sturgis just waited patiently by her, every now and then peeping among the congregation\n",
      "of heads in the body of the court, to see if her husband were still there. And there he always was\n",
      "to be seen, looking and listening with all his might. His wife felt easy that he would not be\n",
      "wanting her at home until the trial was ended.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary never let go her clutched hold on the rails. She wanted them to steady her, in that heaving,\n",
      "whirling court. She thought the feeling of something hard compressed within her hand would help her\n",
      "to listen, for it was such pain, such weary pain in her head, to strive to attend to what was being\n",
      "said. They were all at sea, sailing away on billowy waves, and every one speaking at once, and no\n",
      "one heeding her father, who was calling on them to be silent, and listen to him. Then again, for a\n",
      "brief second, the court stood still, and she could see the judge, sitting up there like an idol,\n",
      "with his trappings, so rigid and stiff; and Jem, opposite, looking at her, as if to say, Am I to die\n",
      "for what you know your ——. Then she checked herself, and by a great struggle brought herself round\n",
      "to an instant's sanity. But the round of thought never stood still; and off she went again; and\n",
      "every time her power of struggling against the growing delirium grew fainter and fainter. She\n",

      "closely attending to the case for the prosecution, which was now being wound up.</p>\n",
      "<p>The counsel for the prisoner had avoided much cross-examination, reserving to himself the right\n",
      "of calling the witnesses forward again; for he had received so little, and such vague instructions,\n",
      "and understood that so much depended on the evidence of one who was not forthcoming, that in fact he\n",
      "had little hope of establishing any thing like a show of a defence, and contented himself with\n",
      "watching the case, and lying in wait for any legal objections that might offer themselves. He lay\n",
      "back on the seat, occasionally taking a pinch of snuff in a manner intended to be contemptuous; now\n",
      "and then elevating his eyebrows, and sometimes exchanging a little note with Mr. Bridgenorth behind\n",
      "him. The attorney had far more interest in the case than the barrister, to which he was perhaps\n",
      "excited by his poor old friend Job Legh; who had edged and wedged himself through the crowd close to\n",
      "Mr. Bridgenorth's elbow, sent thither by Ben Sturgis, to whom he had been \"introduced\" by Charley\n",
      "Jones, and who had accounted for Mary's disappearance on the preceding day, and spoken of their\n",
      "chase, their fears, their hopes.</p>\n",
      "<p>All this was told in a few words to Mr. Bridgenorth—so few, that they gave him but a confused\n",
      "idea, that time was of value; and this he named to his counsel, who now rose to speak for the\n",
      "defence.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job Legh looked about for Mary, now he had gained, and given, some idea of the position of\n",
      "things. At last he saw her, standing by a decent-looking woman, looking flushed and anxious, and\n",
      "moving her lips incessantly, as if eagerly talking; her eyes never resting on any object, but\n",
      "wandering about as if in search of something. Job thought it was for him she was seeking, and he\n",
      "struggled to get round to her. When he had succeeded, she took no notice of him, although he spoke\n",
      "to her, but still kept looking round and round in the same wild, restless manner. He tried to hear\n",
      "the low quick mutterings of her voice, as he caught the repetition of the same words over and over\n",
      "again.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I must not go mad. I must not, indeed. They say people tell the truth when they're mad; but I\n",
      "don't. I was always a liar. I was, indeed; but I'm not mad. I must not go mad. I must not,\n",
      "indeed.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly she seemed to become aware how earnestly Job was listening (with mournful attention) to\n",
      "her words, and turning sharp round upon him, with upbraiding for his eaves-dropping on her lips, she\n",
      "caught sight of something,—or some one,—who, even in that state, had power to arrest her attention,\n",
      "and throwing up her arms with wild energy, she shrieked aloud,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Jem! Jem! you're saved; and I <hi>am</hi> mad—\" and was instantly seized with convulsions.\n",
      "With much commiseration she was taken out of court, while the attention of many was diverted from\n",
      "her, by the fierce energy with which a sailor forced his way over rails and seats, against turnkeys\n",
      "and policemen. The officers of the court opposed this forcible manner of entrance, but they could\n",
      "hardly induce the offender to adopt any quieter way of attaining his object, and telling his tale in\n",
      "the witness-box, the legitimate place. For Will had dwelt so impatiently on the danger in which his\n",
      "absence would place his cousin, that even yet he seemed to fear that he might see the prisoner\n",
      "carried off, and hung, before he could pour out the narrative which would exculpate him. As for Job\n",
      "Legh, his feelings were all but uncontrollable; as you may judge by the indifference with which he\n",
      "saw Mary borne, stiff and convulsed, out of the court, in the charge of the kind Mrs. Sturgis, who,\n",
      "you will remember, was an utter stranger to him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She'll keep! I'll not trouble myself about her,\" said he to himself, as he wrote with trembling\n",
      "hands a little note of information to Mr. Bridgenorth, who had conjectured, when Will had first\n",
      "disturbed the awful tranquillity of the life-and-death court, that the witness had arrived (better\n",
      "late than never) on whose evidence rested all the slight chance yet remaining to Jem Wilson of\n",
      "escaping death. During the commotion in the court, among all the cries and commands, the dismay and\n",
      "the directions, consequent upon Will's entrance, and poor Mary's fearful attack of illness, Mr.\n",
      "Bridgenorth had kept his lawyer-like presence of mind; and long before Job Legh's almost illegible\n",
      "note was poked at him, he had recapitulated the facts on which Will had to give evidence, and the\n",
      "manner in which he had been pursued, after his ship had taken her leave of the land.</p>\n",
      "<p>The barrister who defended Jem took new heart when he was put in possession of these striking\n",
      "points to be adduced, not so much out of earnestness to save the prisoner, of whose innocence he was\n",
      "still doubtful, as because he saw the opportunities for the display of forensic eloquence which were\n",
      "presented by the facts; \"a gallant tar brought back from the pathless ocean by a girl's noble\n",
      "daring,\" \"the dangers of too hastily judging from circumstantial evidence,\" &amp;c., &amp;c.; while\n",
      "the counsellor for the prosecution prepared himself by folding his arms, elevating his eyebrows, and\n",
      "putting his lips in the form in which they might best whistle down the wind such evidence as might\n",
      "be produced by a suborned witness, who dared to perjure himself. For, of course, it is etiquette to\n",
      "suppose that such evidence as may be given against the opinion which lawyers are paid to uphold, is\n",
      "any thing but based on truth; and \"perjury,\" \"conspiracy,\" and \"peril of your immortal soul,\" are\n",
      "light expressions to throw at the heads of those who may prove (not the speaker, there would then be\n",
      "some excuse for the hasty words of personal anger, but) the hirer of the speaker to be wrong, or\n",
      "mistaken.</p>\n",
      "<p>But when once Will had attained his end, and felt that his tale, or part of a tale, would be\n",
      "heard by judge and jury; when once he saw Jem standing safe and well before him (even though he saw\n",
      "him pale and care-worn at the felon's bar); his courage took the shape of presence of mind, and he\n",
      "awaited the examination with a calm, unflinching intelligence, which dictated the clearest and most\n",
      "pertinent answers. He told the story you know so well: how his leave of absence being nearly\n",
      "expired, he had resolved to fulfil his promise, and go to see an uncle residing in the Isle of Man;\n",
      "how his money (sailor-like) was all expended in Manchester, and how, consequently, it had been\n",
      "necessary for him to walk to Liverpool, which he had accordingly done on the very night of the\n",
      "murder, accompanied as far as Hollins Greeb by his friend and cousin, the prisoner at the bar. He\n",
      "was clear and distinct in every corroborative circumstance, and gave a short account of the singular\n",
      "way in which he had been recalled from his outward-bound voyage, and the terrible anxiety he had\n",
      "felt, as the pilot-boat had struggled home against the wind. The jury felt that their opinion (so\n",
      "nearly decided half an hour ago) was shaken and disturbed in a very uncomfortable and perplexing\n",
      "way, and were almost grateful to the counsel for the prosecution, when he got up, with a brow of\n",
      "thunder, to demolish the evidence, which was so bewildering when taken in connexion with every thing\n",
      "previously adduced. But if such, without looking to the consequences, was the first impulsive\n",
      "feeling of some among the jury, how shall I describe the vehemence of passion which possessed the\n",
      "mind of poor Mr. Carson, as he saw the effect of the young sailor's statement? It never shook his\n",
      "belief in Jem's guilt in the least, that attempt at an alibi; his hatred, his longing for vengeance,\n",
      "having once defined an object to itself, could no more bear to be frustrated and disappointed than\n",
      "the beast of prey can submit to have his victim taken from his hungry jaws. No more likeness to the\n",
      "calm stern power of Jupiter was there in that white eager face, almost distorted by its fell anxiety\n",
      "of expression.</p>\n",
      "<p>The counsel to whom etiquette assigned the cross-examination of Will, caught the look on Mr.\n",
      "Carson's face, and in his desire to further the intense wish there manifested, he over-shot his mark\n",
      "even in his first insulting question:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And now, my man, you've told the court a very good and very convincing story; no reasonable man\n",
      "ought to doubt the unstained innocence of your relation at the bar. Still there is one circumstance\n",
      "you have forgotten to name; and I feel that without it your evidence is rather incomplete. Will you\n",

      "very plausible story? How much good coin of Her Majesty's realm have you received, or are you to\n",
      "receive, for walking up from the docks, or some less creditable place, and uttering the tale you\n",
      "have just now repeated,—very much to the credit of your instructor, I must say? Remember, sir, you\n",
      "are upon oath.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It took Will a minute to extract the meaning from the garb of unaccustomed words in which it was\n",
      "invested, and during this time he looked a little confused. But the instant the truth flashed upon\n",
      "him, he fixed his bright clear eyes, flaming with indignation, upon the counsellor, whose look fell\n",
      "at last before that stern unflinching gaze. Then, and not till then, Will made answer.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Will you tell the judge and jury how much money you've been paid for your impudence towards one\n",
      "who has told God's blessed truth, and who would scorn to tell a lie, or blackguard any one, for the\n",
      "biggest fee as ever lawyer got for doing dirty work? Will you tell, sir?— But I'm ready, my lord\n",
      "judge, to take my oath as many times as your lordship or the jury would like, to testify to things\n",
      "having happened just as I said. There's O'Brien, the pilot, in court now. Would somebody with a wig\n",
      "on please to ask him how much he can say for me?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It was a good idea, and caught at by the counsel for the defence. O'Brien gave just such\n",
      "testimony as was required to clear Will from all suspicion. He had witnessed the pursuit, he had\n",
      "heard the conversation which took place between the boat and the ship; he had given Will a homeward\n",
      "passage in his boat. And the character of an accredited pilot, appointed by Trinity House, was known\n",
      "to be above suspicion.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson sank back on his seat in sickening despair. He knew enough of courts to be aware of\n",
      "the extreme unwillingness of juries to convict, even where the evidence is most clear, when the\n",
      "penalty of such conviction is death. At the period of the trial most condemnatory to the prisoner,\n",
      "he had repeated this fact to himself in order to damp his too certain expectation of a conviction.\n",
      "Now it needed not repetition, for it forced itself upon his consciousness, and he seemed to\n",
      "<hi>know</hi>, even before the jury retired to consult, that by some trick, some negligence, some\n",
      "miserable hocus-pocus, the murderer of his child, his darling, his Absalom, who had never\n",
      "rebelled,—the slayer of his unburied boy would slip through the fangs of justice, and walk free and\n",
      "unscathed over that earth where his son would never more be seen.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was even so. The prisoner hid his face once more to shield the expression of an emotion he\n",
      "could not control, from the notice of the over-curious; Job Legh ceased his eager talking to Mr.\n",
      "Bridgenorth; Charley looked grave and earnest; for the jury filed one by one back into their box,\n",
      "and the question was asked to which such an awful answer might be given.</p>\n",
      "<p>The verdict they had come to was unsatisfactory to themselves at last; neither being convinced of\n",
      "his innocence, nor yet quite willing to believe him guilty in the teeth of the alibi. But the\n",
      "punishment that awaited him, if guilty, was so terrible, and so unnatural a sentence for man to\n",
      "pronounce on man, that the knowledge of it had weighed down the scale on the side of innocence, and\n",
      "\"Not Guilty\" was the verdict that thrilled through the breathless court.</p>\n",
      "<p>One moment of silence, and then the murmurs rose, as the verdict was discussed by all with\n",
      "lowered voice. Jem stood motionless, his head bowed; poor fellow, he was stunned with the rapid\n",
      "career of events during the last few hours.</p>\n",
      "<p>He had assumed his place at the bar with little or no expectation of an acquittal; and with\n",
      "scarcely any desire for life, in the complication of occurrences tending to strengthen the idea of\n",
      "Mary's more than indifference to him; she had loved another, and in her mind Jem believed that he\n",
      "himself must be regarded as the murderer of him she loved. And suddenly, athwart this gloom which\n",
      "made life seem such a blank expanse of desolation, there flashed the exquisite delight of hearing\n",
      "Mary's avowal of love, making the future all glorious, if a future in this world he might hope to\n",
      "have. He could not dwell on any thing but her words, telling of her passionate love; all else was\n",
      "indistinct, nor could he strive to make it otherwise. She loved him.</p>\n",
      "<p>And Life, now full of tender images, suddenly bright with all exquisite promises, hung on a\n",
      "breath, the slenderest gossamer chance. He tried to think that the knowledge of her love would\n",
      "soothe him even in his dying hours; but the phantoms of what life with her might be, would obtrude,\n",
      "and made him almost gasp and reel under the uncertainty he was enduring. Will's appearance had only\n",
      "added to the intensity of this suspense.</p>\n",
      "<p>The full meaning of the verdict could not at once penetrate his brain. He stood dizzy and\n",
      "motionless. Some one pulled his coat. He turned, and saw Job Legh, the tears stealing down his brown\n",
      "furrowed cheeks, while he tried in vain to command voice enough to speak. He kept shaking Jem by the\n",
      "hand as the best and necessary expression of his feeling.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Here! make yourself scarce! I should think you'd be glad to get out of that!\" exclaimed the\n",
      "gaoler, as he brought up another livid prisoner, from out whose eyes came the anxiety which he would\n",
      "not allow any other feature to display.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job Legh pressed out of court, and Jem followed unreasoningly.</p>\n",
      "<p>The crowd made way, and kept their garments tight about them, as Jem passed, for about him there\n",
      "still hung the taint of the murderer.</p>\n",
      "<p>He was in the open air, and free once more! Although many looked on him with suspicion, faithful\n",
      "friends closed round him; his arm was unresistingly pumped up and down by his cousin and Job; when\n",
      "one was tired, the other took up the wholesome exercise, while Ben Sturgis was working off his\n",
      "interest in the scene by scolding Charley for walking on his head round and round Mary's sweetheart,\n",
      "for a sweetheart he was now satisfactorily ascertained to be, in spite of her assertion to the\n",
      "contrary. And all this time Jem himself felt bewildered and dazzled; he would have given any thing\n",
      "for an hour's uninterrupted thought on the occurrences of the past week, and the new visions raised\n",
      "up during the morning; aye, even though that tranquil hour were to be passed in the hermitage of his\n",
      "quiet prison cell. The first question sobbed out by his choking voice, oppressed with emotion,\n",
      "was,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Where is she?\"</p>\n",

      "restrained with such effort during the last few days. They brought her son to her, and she threw\n",
      "herself upon his neck, weeping there. He returned her embrace, but looked around, beyond. Excepting\n",
      "his mother there was no one in the room but the friends who had entered with him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Eh, lad!\" said she, when she found voice to speak. \"See what it is to have behaved thysel! I\n",

      "of it, Job, as a man should do,\" said Jem, his sobs choking him.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Let me in, will you?\" said Job, pushing past him, for all this time Jem had stood holding the\n",
      "door, unwilling to admit Job where he might hear so much that would be suggestive to one acquainted\n",
      "with the parties that Mary named.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'd more than one reason for coming betimes. I wanted to hear how yon poor wench was;—that stood\n",
      "first. Late last night I got a letter from Margaret, very anxious-like. The doctor says the old lady\n",
      "yonder can't last many days longer, and it seems so lonesome for her to die with no one but Margaret\n",
      "and Mrs. Davenport about her. So I thought I'd just come and stay with Mary Barton, and see as she's\n",
      "well done to, and you and your mother and Will go and take leave of old Alice.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem's countenance, sad at best just now, fell lower and lower. But Job went on with his\n",
      "speech.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She still wanders, Margaret says, and thinks she's with her mother at home; but for all that,\n",
      "she should have some kith and kin near her to close her eyes, to my thinking.\"</p>\n",

      "interrupted,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Lad! if thou knew what thy mother has suffered for thee, thou'd not speak of leaving her just\n",
      "when she's got thee from the grave as it were. Why, this very night she roused me up, and 'Job,'\n",
      "says she, 'I ask your pardon for wakening you, but tell me, am I awake or dreaming? Is Jem proved\n",
      "innocent? Oh, Job Legh! God send I've not been only dreaming it!' For thou see'st she can't rightly\n",
      "understand why thou'rt with Mary, and not with her. Ay, ay! I know why; but a mother only gives up\n",
      "her son's heart inch by inch to his wife, and then she gives it up with a grudge. No, Jem! thou must\n",
      "go with thy mother just now, if ever thou hopest for God's blessing. She's a widow, and has none but\n",
      "thee. Never fear for Mary! She's young and will struggle through. They are decent people, these folk\n",
      "she is with, and I'll watch o'er her as though she was my own poor girl, that lies cold enough in\n",
      "London-town. I grant ye, it's hard enough for her to be left among strangers. To my mind John Barton\n",
      "would be more in the way of his duty, looking after his daughter, than delegating it up and down the\n",
      "country, looking after every one's business but his own.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>A new idea and a new fear came into Jem's mind. What if Mary should implicate her father?</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She raves terribly,\" said he. \"All night long she's been speaking of her father, and mixing up\n",
      "thoughts of him with the trial she saw yesterday. I should not wonder if she'll speak of him as\n",

      "<p>\"I should na wonder, either,\" answered Job. \"Folk in her way say many and many a strange thing;\n",

      "<p>Jem felt how right Job was, and could not resist what he knew to be his duty, but I cannot tell\n",
      "you how heavy and sick at heart he was as he stood at the door to take a last fond, lingering look\n",
      "at Mary. He saw her sitting up in bed, her golden hair, dimmed with her one day's illness, floating\n",
      "behind her, her head bound round with wetted cloths, her features all agitated, even to distortion,\n",
      "with the pangs of her anxiety.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her lover's eyes filled with tears. He could not hope. The elasticity of his heart had been\n",
      "crushed out of him by early sorrows; and now, especially, the dark side of every thing seemed to be\n",
      "presented to him. What if she died, just when he knew the treasure, the untold treasure he possessed\n",
      "in her love! What if (worse than death) she remained a poor gibbering maniac all her life long (and\n",

      "terror-distracted as she was now, and no one able to comfort her!</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem!\" said Job, partly guessing the other's feelings by his own. \"Jem!\" repeated he, arresting\n",
      "his attention before he spoke. Jem turned round, the little motion causing the tears to overflow and\n",
      "trickle down his cheeks. \"Thou must trust in God, and leave her in His hands.\" He spoke hushed, and\n",
      "low; but the words sank all the more into Jem's heart, and gave him strength to tear himself\n",
      "away.</p>\n",
      "<p>He found his mother (notwithstanding that she had but just regained her child through Mary's\n",
      "instrumentality) half inclined to resent his having passed the night in anxious devotion to the poor\n",
      "invalid. She dwelt on the duties of children to their parents (above all others), till Jem could\n",
      "hardly believe the relative positions they had held only yesterday, when she was struggling with and\n",
      "controlling every instinct of her nature, only because <hi>he</hi> wished it. However, the\n",
      "recollection of that yesterday, with its hair's breadth between him and a felon's death, and the\n",
      "love that had lightened the dark shadow, made him bear with the meekness and patience of a\n",
      "true-hearted man all the worrying little acerbities of to-day; and he had no small merit in so\n",
      "doing; for in him, as in his mother, the re-action after intense excitement had produced its usual\n",
      "effect in increased irritability of the nervous system.</p>\n",
      "<p>They found Alice alive, and without pain. And that was all. A child of a few weeks old would have\n",
      "had more bodily strength; a child of a very few months old, more consciousness of what was passing\n",
      "before her. But even in this state she diffused an atmosphere of peace around her. True, Will, at\n",
      "first, wept passionate tears at the sight of her, who had been as a mother to him, so standing on\n",
      "the confines of life. But even now, as always, loud passionate feeling could not long endure in the\n",
      "calm of her presence. The firm faith which her mind had no longer power to grasp, had left its trail\n",
      "of glory; for by no other word can I call the bright happy look which illumined the old earth-worn\n",
      "face. Her talk, it is true, bore no more that constant earnest reference to God and His holy Word\n",
      "which it had done in health, and there were no death-bed words of exhortation from the lips of one\n",
      "so habitually pious. For still she imagined herself once again in the happy, happy realms of\n",
      "childhood; and again dwelling in the lovely northern haunts where she had so often longed to be.\n",
      "Though earthly sight was gone away, she beheld again the scenes she had loved from long years ago!\n",
      "she saw them without a change to dim the old radiant hues. The long dead were with her, fresh and\n",
      "blooming as in those bygone days. And death came to her as a welcome blessing, like as evening comes\n",
      "to the weary child. Her work here was finished, and faithfully done.</p>\n",
      "<p>What better sentence can an emperor wish to have said over his bier? In second childhood (that\n",
      "blessing clouded by a name), she said her \"Nunc Dimittis,\"—the sweetest canticle to the holy.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother, good night! Dear mother! bless me once more! I'm very tired, and would fain go to\n",
      "sleep.\" She never spoke again on this side Heaven.</p>\n",
      "<p>She died the day after their return from Liverpool. From that time, Jem became aware that his\n",
      "mother was jealously watching for some word or sign which should betoken his wish to return to Mary.\n",
      "And yet go to Liverpool he must and would, as soon as the funeral was over, if but for a single\n",
      "glimpse of his darling. For Job had never written; indeed, any necessity for his so doing had never\n",
      "entered his head. If Mary died, he would announce it personally; if she recovered, he meant to bring\n",
      "her home with him. Writing was to him little more than an auxiliary to natural history; a way of\n",
      "ticketing specimens, not of expressing thoughts.</p>\n",
      "<p>The consequence of this want of intelligence as to Mary's state was, that Jem was constantly\n",
      "anticipating that every person and every scrap of paper was to convey to him the news of her death.\n",
      "He could not endure this state long; but he resolved not to disturb the house by announcing to his\n",
      "mother his purposed intention of returning to Liverpool, until the dead had been carried forth.</p>\n",
      "<p>On Sunday afternoon they laid her low with many tears. Will wept as one who would not be\n",
      "comforted.</p>\n",
      "<p>The old childish feeling came over him, the feeling of loneliness at being left among\n",
      "strangers.</p>\n",
      "<p>By and bye, Margaret timidly stole near him, as if waiting to console; and soon his passion sank\n",
      "down to grief, and grief gave way to melancholy, and though he felt as if he never could be joyful\n",
      "again, he was all the while unconsciously approaching nearer to the full happiness of calling\n",
      "Margaret his own, and a golden thread was interwoven even now with the darkness of his sorrow. Yet\n",
      "it was on his arm that Jane Wilson leant on her return homewards. Jem took charge of Margaret.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Margaret, I'm bound for Liverpool by the first train to-morrow; I must set your grandfather at\n",
      "liberty.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm sure he likes nothing better than watching over poor Mary; he loves her nearly as well as\n",
      "me. But let me go! I have been so full of poor Alice, I've never thought of it before; I can't do so\n",
      "much as many a one, but Mary will like to have a woman about her that she knows. I'm sorry I waited\n",
      "to be reminded, Jem.\" replied Margaret, with some little self-reproach.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Margaret's proposition did not at all agree with her companion's wishes. He found he had\n",
      "better speak out, and put his intention at once to the right motive; the subterfuge about setting\n",
      "Job Legh at liberty had done him harm instead of good.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To tell truth, Margaret, it's I that must go, and that for my own sake, not your grandfather's.\n",
      "I can rest neither by night nor day for thinking on Mary. Whether she lives or dies I look on her as\n",
      "my wife before God, as surely and solemnly as if we were married. So being, I have the greatest\n",
      "right to look after her, and I cannot yield it even to—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Her father,\" said Margaret, finishing his interrupted sentence. \"It seems strange that a girl\n",
      "like her should be thrown on the bare world to struggle through so bad an illness. No one seems to\n",
      "know where John Barton is, else I thought of getting Morris to write him a letter telling him about\n",
      "Mary. I wish he was home, that I do!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem could not echo this wish.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary's not bad off for friends where she is,\" said he. \"I call them friends, though a week ago\n",
      "we none of us knew there were such folks in the world. But being anxious and sorrowful about the\n",
      "same thing makes people friends quicker than any thing, I think. She's like a mother to Mary in her\n",
      "ways; and he bears a good character, as far as I could learn just in that hurry. We're drawing near\n",
      "home, and I've not said my say, Margaret. I want you to look after mother a bit. She'll not like my\n",
      "going, and I've got to break it to her yet. If she takes it very badly, I'll come back to-morrow\n",
      "night; but if she's not against it very much, I mean to stay till it's settled about Mary, one way\n",
      "or the other. Will, you know, will be there, Margaret, to help a bit in doing for mother.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Will's being there made the only objection Margaret saw to this plan. She disliked the idea of\n",
      "seeming to throw herself in his way; and yet she did not like to say any thing of this feeling to\n",
      "Jem, who had all along seemed perfectly unconscious of any love-affair, besides his own, in\n",
      "progress.</p>\n",
      "<p>So Margaret gave a reluctant consent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If you can just step up to our house to-night, Jem, I'll put up a few things as may be useful to\n",
      "Mary, and then you can say when you'll likely be back. If you come home to-morrow night, and Will's\n",
      "there, perhaps I need not step up?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, Margaret, do! I shan't leave easy unless you go some time in the day to see mother. I'll\n",
      "come to-night, though; and now good-bye. Stay! do you think you could just coax poor Will to walk a\n",
      "bit home with you, that I might speak to mother by myself?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>No! that Margaret could not do. That was expecting too great a sacrifice of bashful feeling.</p>\n",
      "<p>But the object was accomplished by Will's going up-stairs immediately on their return to the\n",
      "house, to indulge his mournful thoughts alone. As soon as Jem and his mother were left by\n",
      "themselves, he began on the subject uppermost in his mind.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She put her handkerchief from her eyes, and turned quickly round so as to face him where he\n",
      "stood, thinking what best to say. The little action annoyed him, and he rushed at once into the\n",
      "subject.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother! I am going back to Liverpool to-morrow morning to see how Mary Barton is.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And what's Mary Barton to thee, that thou shouldst be running after her in that-a-way?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If she lives, she shall be my wedded wife. If she dies—mother, I can't speak of what I shall\n",
      "feel if she dies.\" His voice was choked in his throat.</p>\n",
      "<p>For an instant his mother was interested by his words; and then came back the old jealousy of\n",
      "being supplanted in the affections of that son, who had been, as it were, newly born to her, by the\n",
      "escape he had so lately experienced from danger. So she hardened her heart against entertaining any\n",
      "feeling of sympathy; and turned away from the face, which recalled the earnest look of his\n",
      "childhood, when he had come to her in some trouble, sure of help and comfort.</p>\n",
      "<p>And coldly she spoke, in those tones which Jem knew and dreaded, even before the meaning they\n",
      "expressed was fully shaped. \"Thou'rt old enough to please thysel. Old mothers are cast aside, and\n",
      "what they've borne forgotten, as soon as a pretty face comes across. I might have thought of that\n",
      "last Tuesday, when I felt as if thou wert all my own, and the judge were some wild animal trying to\n",
      "rend thee from me. I spoke up for thee then; but it's all forgotten now, I suppose.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother! you know all this while, <hi>you know</hi> I can never forget any kindness you've ever\n",
      "done for me; and they've been many. Why should you think I've only room for one love in my heart? I\n",
      "can love you as dearly as ever, and Mary too, as much as man ever loved woman.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He awaited a reply. None was vouchsafed.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother, answer me!\" said he, at last.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What mun I answer? You asked me no question.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well! I ask you this now. To-morrow morning I go to Liverpool to see her, who is as my wife.\n",
      "Dear mother! will you bless me on my errand? If it please God she recovers, will you take her to you\n",
      "as you would a daughter?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She could neither refuse nor assent.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why need you go?\" said she querulously, at length. \"You'll be getting in some mischief or\n",
      "another again. Can't you stop at home quiet with me?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem got up, and walked about the room in despairing impatience. She would not understand his\n",
      "feelings. At last he stopped right before the place where she was sitting, with an air of injured\n",
      "meekness on her face.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother! I often think what a good man father was! I've often heard you tell of your courting\n",
      "days; and of the accident that befell you, and how ill you were. How long is it ago?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Near upon five-and-twenty years,\" said she, with a sigh.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You little thought when you were so ill you should live to have such a fine strapping son as I\n",
      "am, did you now?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She smiled a little, and looked up at him, which was just what he wanted.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thou'rt not so fine a man as thy father was, by a deal!\" said she, looking at him with much\n",
      "fondness, notwithstanding her depreciatory words.</p>\n",
      "<p>He took another turn or two up and down the room. He wanted to bend the subject round to his own\n",
      "case.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Those were happy days when father was alive!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You may say so, lad! Such days as will never come again to me, at any rate.\" She sighed\n",
      "sorrowfully.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother!\" said he at last, stopping short, and taking her hand in his with tender affection,\n",
      "\"you'd like me to be as happy a man as my father was before me, would not you? You'd like me to have\n",
      "some one to make me as happy as you made father? Now, would you not, dear mother?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I did not make him as happy as I might ha' done,\" murmured she, in a low, sad voice of\n",
      "self-reproach. \"Th' accident gave a jar to my temper it's never got the better of; and now he's gone\n",
      "where he can never know how I grieve for having frabbed him as I did.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay, mother, we don't know that!\" said Jem, with gentle soothing. \"Any how, you and father got\n",
      "along with as few rubs as most people. But for <hi>his</hi> sake, dear mother, don't say me nay, now\n",
      "that I come to you to ask your blessing before setting out to see her, who is to be my wife, if ever\n",
      "woman is; for <hi>his</hi> sake, if not for mine, love her who I shall bring home to be to me all\n",
      "you were to him: and mother! I do not ask for a truer or a tenderer heart than yours is, in the long\n",
      "run.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The hard look left her face; though her eyes were still averted from Jem's gaze, it was more\n",
      "because they were brimming over with tears, called forth by his words, than because any angry\n",
      "feeling yet remained. And when his manly voice died away in low pleadings, she lifted up her hands,\n",
      "and bent down her son's head below the level of her own; and then she solemnly uttered a\n",
      "blessing.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"God bless thee, Jem, my own dear lad. And may He bless Mary Barton for thy sake.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem's heart leaped up, and from this time hope took the place of fear in his anticipations with\n",
      "regard to Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother! you show your own true self to Mary, and she'll love you as dearly as I do.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>So with some few smiles, and some few tears, and much earnest talking, the evening wore away.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I must be off to see Margaret. Why, it's near ten o'clock! Could you have thought it? Now don't\n",
      "you stop up for me, mother. You and Will go to bed, for you've both need of it. I shall be home in\n",
      "an hour.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret had felt the evening long and lonely; and was all but giving up the thoughts of Jem's\n",
      "coming that night, when she heard his step at the door.</p>\n",
      "<p>He told her of his progress with his mother; he told her his hopes, and was silent on the subject\n",
      "of his fears.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To think how sorrow and joy are mixed up together. You'll date your start in life as Mary's\n",
      "acknowledged lover from poor Alice Wilson's burial day. Well! the dead are soon forgotten!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear Margaret!—But you're worn out with your long evening waiting for me. I don't wonder. But\n",
      "never you, nor any one else, think because God sees fit to call up new interests, perhaps right out\n",
      "of the grave, that therefore the dead are forgotten. Margaret, you yourself can remember our looks,\n",
      "and fancy what we're like.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes! but what has that to do with remembering Alice?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, just this. You're not always trying to think on our faces, and making a labour of\n",
      "remembering; but often, I'll be bound, when you're sinking off to sleep, or when you're very quiet\n",
      "and still, the faces you knew so well when you could see, come smiling before you with loving looks.\n",
      "Or you remember them, without striving after it, and without thinking it's your duty to keep\n",
      "recalling them. And so it is with them that are hidden from our sight. If they've been worthy to be\n",
      "heartily loved while alive, they'll not be forgotten when dead; it's against nature. And we need no\n",
      "more be upbraiding ourselves for letting in God's rays of light upon our sorrow, and no more be\n",
      "fearful of forgetting them, because their memory is not always haunting and taking up our minds,\n",
      "than you need to trouble yourself about remembering your grandfather's face, or what the stars were\n",
      "like,—you can't forget if you would, what it's such a pleasure to think about. Don't fear my\n",
      "forgetting Aunt Alice.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm not, Jem; not now, at least; only you seemed so full about Mary.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I've kept it down so long, remember. How glad Aunt Alice would have been to know that I might\n",
      "hope to have her for my wife! that's to say, if God spares her!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"She would not have known it, even if you could have told her this last fortnight,—ever since you\n",
      "went away she's been thinking always that she was a little child at her mother's apron-string. She\n",
      "must have been a happy little thing; it was such a pleasure to her to think about those early days,\n",
      "when she lay old and gray on her death-bed.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I never knew any one seem more happy all her life long.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! and how gentle and easy her death was! She thought her mother was near her.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They fell into calm thought about those last peaceful happy hours.</p>\n",
      "<p>It struck eleven. Jem started up.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I should have been gone long ago. Give me the bundle. You'll not forget my mother. Good night,\n",
      "Margaret.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She let him out and bolted the door behind him. He stood on the steps to adjust some fastening\n",
      "about the bundle. The court, the street, was deeply still. Long ago had all retired to rest on that\n",
      "quiet Sabbath evening. The stars shone down on the silent deserted streets, and the soft clear\n",
      "moonlight fell in bright masses, leaving the steps on which Jem stood in shadow.</p>\n",
      "<p>A foot-fall was heard along the pavement; slow and heavy was the sound. Before Jem had ended his\n",
      "little piece of business, a form had glided into sight; a wan, feeble figure, bearing, with evident\n",
      "and painful labour, a jug of water from the neighbouring pump. It went before Jem, turned up the\n",
      "court at the corner of which he was standing, passed into the broad, calm light; and there, with\n",
      "bowed head, sinking and shrunk body, Jem recognised John Barton.</p>\n",
      "<p>No haunting ghost could have had less of the energy of life in its involuntary motions than he,\n",
      "who, nevertheless, went on with the same measured clock-work tread until the door of his own house\n",
      "was reached. And then he disappeared, and the latch fell feebly to, and made a faint and wavering\n",
      "sound, breaking the solemn silence of the night. Then all again was still.</p>\n",
      "<p>For a minute or two Jem stood motionless, stunned by the thoughts which the sight of Mary's\n",
      "father had called up.</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret did not know he was at home: had he stolen like a thief by dead of night into his own\n",
      "dwelling? Depressed as Jem had often and long seen him, this night there was something different\n",
      "about him still; beaten down by some inward storm, he seemed to grovel along, all self-respect lost\n",
      "and gone.</p>\n",
      "<p>Must he be told of Mary's state? Jem felt he must not; and this for many reasons. He could not be\n",
      "informed of her illness without many other particulars being communicated at the same time, of which\n",
      "it were better he should be kept in ignorance; indeed, of which Mary herself could alone give the\n",
      "full explanation. No suspicion that he was the criminal seemed hitherto to have been excited in the\n",
      "mind of any one. Added to these reasons was Jem's extreme unwillingness to face him, with the belief\n",
      "in his breast that he, and none other, had done the fearful deed.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was true that he was Mary's father, and as such had every right to be told of all concerning\n",
      "her; but supposing he were, and that he followed the impulse so natural to a father, and wished to\n",
      "go to her, what might be the consequences? Among the mingled feelings she had revealed in her\n",
      "delirium, ay, mingled even with the most tender expressions of love for her father, was a sort of\n",
      "horror of him; a dread of him as a blood-shedder, which seemed to separate him into two\n",
      "persons,—one, the father who had dandled her on his knee, and loved her all her life long; the\n",
      "other, the assassin, the cause of all her trouble and woe.</p>\n",
      "<p>If he presented himself before her while this idea of his character was uppermost, who might tell\n",
      "the consequence?</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem could not, and would not, expose her to any such fearful chance: and to tell the truth, I\n",
      "believe he looked upon her as more his own, to guard from all shadow of injury with most loving\n",
      "care, than as belonging to any one else in this world, though girt with the reverend name of Father,\n",
      "and guiltless of aught that might have lessened such reverence.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you think this account of mine confused, of the half-feelings, half-reasons, which passed\n",
      "through Jem's mind, as he stood gazing at the empty space, where that crushed form had so lately\n",
      "been seen,—if you are perplexed to disentangle the real motives, I do assure you it was from just\n",
      "such an involved set of thoughts that Jem drew the resolution to act as if he had not seen that\n",

      "entertained. But the state of things, if not less anxious, was less distressing than when Jem had\n",

      "suffering. She slept a natural sleep; and they stole about on tip-toe, and spoke low, and softly,\n",
      "and hardly dared to breathe, however much they longed to sigh out their thankful relief.</p>\n",
      "<p>She opened her eyes. Her mind was in the tender state of a lately-born infant's. She was pleased\n",

      "the window. But she did not care to exert herself to ask any questions, although she saw Mrs.\n",

      "<p>She fell softly into slumber, without a word having been spoken by any one during that half hour\n",
      "of inexpressible joy. And again the stillness was enforced by sign and whispered word, but with eyes\n",
      "that beamed out their bright thoughts of hope. Jem sat by the side of the bed, holding back the\n",
      "little curtain, and gazing as if he could never gaze his fill at the pale, wasted face, so marbled\n",
      "and so chiselled in its wan outline.</p>\n",
      "<p>She wakened once more; her soft eyes opened, and met his over-bending look. She smiled gently, as\n",
      "a baby does when it sees its mother tending its little cot; and continued her innocent, infantine\n",
      "gaze into his face, as if the sight gave her much unconscious pleasure. But by-and-by a different\n",
      "expression came into her sweet eyes; a look of memory and intelligence; her white face flushed the\n",
      "brightest rosy red, and with feeble motion she tried to hide her head in the pillow.</p>\n",
      "<p>It required all Jem's self-control to do what he knew and felt to be necessary, to call Mrs.\n",
      "Sturgis, who was quietly dozing by the fireside; and that done, he felt almost obliged to leave the\n",
      "room to keep down the happy agitation which would gush out in every feature, every gesture, and\n",

      "<p>From that time forward Mary's progress towards health was rapid.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was every reason, but one, in favour of her speedy removal home. All Jem's duties lay in\n",
      "Manchester. It was his mother's dwelling-place, and there his plans for life had been to be worked\n",
      "out; plans, which the suspicion and imprisonment he had fallen into, had thrown for a time into a\n",
      "chaos, which his presence was required to arrange into form. For he might find, in spite of a jury's\n",
      "verdict, that too strong a taint was on his character for him ever to labour in Manchester again. He\n",
      "remembered the manner in which some one suspected of having been a convict was shunned by masters\n",
      "and men, when he had accidentally met with work in their foundry; the recollection smote him now,\n",
      "how he himself had thought that it did not become an honest upright man to associate with one who\n",
      "had been a prisoner. He could not choose but think on that poor humble being, with his downcast\n",
      "conscious look; hunted out of the work-shop, where he had sought to earn an honest livelihood, by\n",
      "the looks, and half-spoken words, and the black silence of repugnance (worse than words to bear),\n",
      "that met him on all sides.</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem felt that his own character had been attainted; and that to many it might still appear\n",
      "suspicious. He knew that he could convince the world, by a future as blameless as his past had been,\n",
      "that he was innocent. But at the same time he saw that he must have patience, and nerve himself for\n",
      "some trials; and the sooner these were undergone, the sooner he was aware of the place he held in\n",
      "men's estimation, the better. He longed to have presented himself once more at the foundry; and then\n",
      "the reality would drive away the pictures that would (unbidden) come of a shunned man, eyed askance\n",
      "by all, and driven forth to shape out some new career.</p>\n",
      "<p>I said every reason \"but one\" inclined Jem to hasten Mary's return as soon as she was\n",
      "sufficiently convalescent. That one was the meeting which awaited her at home.</p>\n",
      "<p>Turn it over as Jem would, he could not decide what was the best course to pursue. He could\n",
      "compel himself to any line of conduct that his reason and his sense of right told him to be\n",
      "desirable; but they did not tell him it was desirable to speak to Mary, in her tender state of mind\n",
      "and body, of her father. How much would be implied by the mere mention of his name! Speak it as\n",
      "calmly, and as indifferently as he might, he could not avoid expressing some consciousness of the\n",
      "terrible knowledge she possessed.</p>\n",
      "<p>She, for her part, was softer and gentler than she had ever been in her gentlest mood; since her\n",
      "illness, her motions, her glances, her voice were all tender in their languor. It seemed almost a\n",
      "trouble to her to break the silence with the low sounds of her own sweet voice, and her words fell\n",
      "sparingly on Jem's greedy, listening ear.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her face was, however, so full of love and confidence, that Jem felt no uneasiness at the state\n",
      "of silent abstraction into which she often fell. If she did but love him, all would yet go right;\n",
      "and it was better not to press for confidence on that one subject which must be painful to both.</p>\n",
      "<p>There came a fine, bright, balmy day. And Mary tottered once more out into the open air, leaning\n",
      "on Jem's arm, and close to his beating heart. And Mrs. Sturgis watched them from her door, with a\n",
      "blessing on her lips, as they went slowly up the street.</p>\n",
      "<p>They came in sight of the river. Mary shuddered.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Jem! take me home. Yon river seems all made of glittering, heaving, dazzling metal, just as\n",
      "it did when I began to be ill.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem led her homewards. She dropped her head as searching for something on the ground.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem!\" He was all attention. She paused for an instant. \"When may I go home? To Manchester, I\n",
      "mean. I am so weary of this place; and I would fain be at home.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She spoke in a feeble voice; not at all impatiently, as the words themselves would seem to\n",
      "intimate, but in a mournful way, as if anticipating sorrow even in the very fulfilment of her\n",
      "wishes.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Darling! we will go whenever you wish; whenever you feel strong enough. I asked Job to tell\n",
      "Margaret to get all in readiness for you to go there at first. She'll tend you and nurse you. You\n",
      "must not go home. Job proffered for you to go there.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ah! but I must go home, Jem. I'll try and not fail now in what's right. There are things we must\n",
      "not speak on\" (lowering her voice), \"but you'll be really kind if you'll not speak against my going\n",
      "home. Let us say no more about it, dear Jem. I must go home, and I must go alone.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not alone, Mary!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, alone! I cannot tell you why I ask it. And if you guess, I know you well enough to be sure\n",
      "you'll understand why I ask you never to speak on that again to me, till I begin. Promise, dear Jem,\n",
      "promise!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He promised; to gratify that beseeching face he promised. And then he repented, and felt as if he\n",
      "had done ill. Then again he felt as if she were the best judge, and knowing all (perhaps more than\n",
      "even he did) might be forming plans which his interference would mar.</p>\n",
      "<p>One thing was certain! it was a miserable thing to have this awful forbidden ground of discourse;\n",
      "to guess at each other's thoughts, when eyes were averted, and cheeks blanched, and words stood\n",
      "still, arrested in their flow by some casual allusion.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last a day, fine enough for Mary to travel on, arrived. She had wished to go, but now her\n",
      "courage failed her. How could she have said she was weary of that quiet house, where even Ben\n",
      "Sturgis' grumblings only made a kind of harmonious bass in the concord between him and his wife, so\n",
      "thoroughly did they know each other with the knowledge of many years! How could she have longed to\n",
      "quit that little peaceful room where she had experienced such loving tendence! Even the very check\n",
      "bed-curtains became dear to her under the idea of seeing them no more. If it was so with inanimate\n",
      "objects, if they had such power of exciting regret, what were her feelings with regard to the kind\n",
      "old couple, who had taken the stranger in, and cared for her, and nursed her, as though she had been\n",
      "a daughter? Each wilful sentence spoken in the half unconscious irritation of feebleness came now\n",
      "with avenging self-reproach to her memory, as she hung about Mrs. Sturgis, with many tears, which\n",
      "served instead of words to express her gratitude and love.</p>\n",
      "<p>Ben bustled about with the square bottle of Goldenwasser in one of his hands, and a small tumbler\n",
      "in the other; he went to Mary, Jem, and his wife in succession, pouring out a glass for each and\n",
      "bidding them drink it to keep their spirits up: but as each severally refused, he drank it himself;\n",
      "and passed on to offer the same hospitality to another with the like refusal, and the like\n",
      "result.</p>\n",
      "<p>When he had swallowed the last of the three draughts, he condescended to give his reasons for\n",
      "having done so.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I cannot abide waste. What's poured out mun be drunk. That's my maxim.\" So saying, he replaced\n",
      "the bottle in the cupboard.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was he who in a firm commanding voice at last told Jem and Mary to be off, or they would be\n",
      "too late. Mrs. Sturgis had kept up till then; but as they left her house, she could no longer\n",
      "restrain her tears, and cried aloud in spite of her husband's upbraiding.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Perhaps they'll be too late for th' train!\" exclaimed she, with a degree of hope, as the clock\n",
      "struck two.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What! and come back again! No! no! that would never do. We've done our part, and cried our cry;\n",
      "it's no use going o'er the same ground again. I should ha' to give 'em more out of yon bottle when\n",
      "next parting time came, and them three glasses they had made a hole in the stuff, I can tell you.\n",
      "Time Jack was back from Hamburg with some more.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>When they reached Manchester, Mary looked very white, and the expression on her face was almost\n",
      "stern. She was in fact summoning up her resolution to meet her father if he were at home. Jem had\n",
      "never named his midnight glimpse of John Barton to human being; but Mary had a sort of presentiment\n",
      "that wander where he would, he would seek his home at last. But in what mood she dreaded to think.\n",
      "For the knowledge of her father's capability of guilt seemed to have opened a dark gulf in his\n",
      "character, into the depths of which she trembled to look. At one moment she would fain have claimed\n",
      "protection against the life she must lead, for some time at least, alone with a murderer! She\n",
      "thought of his gloom, before his mind was haunted by the memory of so terrible a crime; his moody,\n",
      "irritable ways. She imagined the evenings as of old: she, toiling at some work, long after houses\n",
      "were shut, and folks abed; he, more savage than he had ever been before with the inward gnawing of\n",
      "his remorse. At such times she could have cried aloud with terror, at the scenes her fancy conjured\n",
      "up.</p>\n",
      "<p>But her filial duty, nay, her love and gratitude for many deeds of kindness done to her as a\n",
      "little child, conquered all fear. She would endure all imaginable terrors, although of daily\n",
      "occurrence. And she would patiently bear all wayward violence of temper; more than patiently would\n",
      "she bear it—pitifully, as one who knew of some awful curse awaiting the blood-shedder. She would\n",
      "watch over him tenderly, as the Innocent should watch over the Guilty; awaiting the gracious\n",
      "seasons, wherein to pour oil and balm into the bitter wounds.</p>\n",
      "<p>With the untroubled peace which the resolve to endure to the end gives, she approached the house\n",
      "that from habit she still called home, but which possessed the holiness of home no longer.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem!\" said she, as they stood at the entrance to the court, close by Job Legh's door, \"you must\n",
      "go in there and wait half-an-hour. Not less. If in that time I don't come back, you go your ways to\n",
      "your mother. Give her my dear love. I will send by Margaret when I want to see you.\" She sighed\n",
      "heavily.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary! Mary! I cannot leave you. You speak as coldly as if we were to be nought to each other.\n",
      "And my heart's bound up in you. I know why you bid me keep away, but—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She put her hand on his arm, as he spoke in a loud agitated tone; she looked into his face with\n",
      "upbraiding love in her eyes, and then she said, while her lips quivered, and he felt her whole frame\n",
      "trembling:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Dear Jem! I often could have told you more of love, if I had not once spoken out so free.\n",
      "Remember that time, Jem, if ever you think me cold. Then, the love that's in my heart would out in\n",
      "words; but now, though I'm silent on the pain I'm feeling in quitting you, the love is in my heart\n",
      "all the same. But this is not the time to speak on such things. If I do not do what I feel to be\n",
      "right now, I may blame myself all my life long! Jem, you promised—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>And so saying she left him. She went quicker than she would otherwise have passed over those few\n",
      "yards of ground, for fear he should still try to accompany her. Her hand was on the latch, and in a\n",
      "breath the door was opened.</p>\n",
      "<p>There sat her father, still and motionless—not even turning his head to see who had entered; but\n",
      "perhaps he recognised the foot-step,—the trick of action.</p>\n",
      "<p>He sat by the fire; the grate I should say, for fire there was none. Some dull, gray ashes,\n",
      "negligently left, long days ago, coldly choked up the bars. He had taken the accustomed seat from\n",
      "mere force of habit, which ruled his automaton-body. For all energy, both physical and mental,\n",
      "seemed to have retreated inwards to some of the great citadels of life, there to do battle against\n",
      "the Destroyer, Conscience.</p>\n",
      "<p>His hands were crossed, his fingers interlaced; usually a position implying some degree of\n",
      "resolution, or strength; but in him it was so faintly maintained, that it appeared more the result\n",
      "of chance; an attitude requiring some application of outward force to alter,—and a blow with a straw\n",
      "seemed as though it would be sufficient.</p>\n",
      "<p>And as for his face, it was sunk and worn,—like a skull, with yet a suffering expression that\n",
      "skulls have not! Your heart would have ached to have seen the man, however hardly you might have\n",
      "judged his crime.</p>\n",
      "<p>But crime and all was forgotten by his daughter, as she saw his abashed look, his smitten\n",
      "helplessness. All along she had felt it difficult (as I may have said before) to reconcile the two\n",
      "ideas, of her father and a blood-shedder. But now it was impossible. He was her father! her own dear\n",
      "father! and in his sufferings, whatever their cause, more dearly loved than ever before. His crime\n",
      "was a thing apart, never more to be considered by her.</p>\n",
      "<p>And tenderly did she treat him, and fondly did she serve him in every way that heart could\n",
      "devise, or hand execute.</p>\n",
      "<p>She had some money about her, the price of her strange services as a witness; and when the\n",
      "lingering dusk drew on, she stole out to effect some purchases necessary for her father's\n",
      "comfort.</p>\n",
      "<p>For how body and soul had been kept together, even as much as they were, during the days he had\n",
      "dwelt alone, no one can say. The house was bare as when Mary had left it, of coal, or of candle, of\n",
      "food, or of blessing in any shape.</p>\n",
      "<p>She came quickly home; but as she passed Job Legh's door, she stopped. Doubtless Jem had long\n",
      "since gone; and doubtless, too, he had given Margaret some good reason for not intruding upon her\n",
      "friend for this night at least, otherwise Mary would have seen her before now.</p>\n",
      "<p>But to-morrow,—would she not come in to-morrow? And who so quick as blind Margaret in noticing\n",
      "tones, and sighs, and even silence?</p>\n",
      "<p>She did not give herself time for further thought, her desire to be once more with her father was\n",
      "too pressing; but she opened the door, before she well knew what to say.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's Mary Barton! I know her by her breathing! Grandfather, it's Mary Barton!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret's joy at meeting her, the open demonstration of her love, affected Mary much; she could\n",

      "<p>\"Ay, ay, Mary! thou'rt looking a bit different to when I saw thee last. Thou'lt give Jem and me\n",
      "good characters for sick nurses, I trust. If all trades fail, I'll turn to that. Jem's place is for\n",
      "life, I reckon. Nay, never redden so, lass. You and he know each other's minds by this time!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Margaret held her hand, and gently smiled into her face.</p>\n",

      "wert before. Lord! child, what's the matter? Art thou going to faint?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>For Mary had sickened at the mention of that name; yet she felt that now or never was the time to\n",
      "speak.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Father's come home!\" she said, \"but he's very poorly; I never saw him as he is now, before. I\n",
      "asked Jem not to come near him for fear it might fidget him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She spoke hastily, and (to her own idea) in an unnatural manner. But they did not seem to notice\n",
      "it, nor to take the hint she had thrown out of company being unacceptable; for Job Legh directly put\n",
      "down some insect, which he was impaling on a corking-pin, and exclaimed,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thy father come home! Why, Jem never said a word of it! And ailing too! I'll go in, and cheer\n",
      "him with a bit of talk. I ne'er knew any good come of delegating it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Job! father cannot stand—father is too ill. Don't come; not but that you're very kind and\n",
      "good; but to-night—indeed,\" said she at last, in despair, seeing Job still persevere in putting away\n",
      "his things; \"you must not come till I send or come for you. Father's in that strange way, I can't\n",
      "answer for it if he sees strangers. Please don't come. I'll come and tell you every day how he goes\n",
      "on. I must be off now to see after him. Dear Job! kind Job! don't be angry with me. If you knew all\n",
      "you'd pity me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>For Job was muttering away in high dudgeon, and even Margaret's tone was altered as she wished\n",
      "Mary good night. Just then she could ill brook coldness from any one, and least of all bear the idea\n",
      "of being considered ungrateful by so kind and zealous a friend as Job had been; so she turned round\n",
      "suddenly, even when her hand was on the latch of the door, and ran back, and threw her arms about\n",
      "his neck, and kissed him first, and then Margaret. And then, the tears fast-falling down her cheeks,\n",
      "but no word spoken, she hastily left the house, and went back to her home.</p>\n",
      "<p>There was no change in her father's position, or in his spectral look. He had answered her\n",
      "questions (but few in number, for so many subjects were unapproachable) by monosyllables, and in a\n",
      "weak, high, childish voice; but he had not lifted his eyes; he could not meet his daughter's look.\n",
      "And she, when she spoke, or as she moved about, avoided letting her eyes rest upon him. She wished\n",
      "to be her usual self; but while every thing was done with a consciousness of purpose, she felt it\n",
      "was impossible.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this manner things went on for some days. At night he feebly clambered up stairs to bed; and\n",
      "during those long dark hours Mary heard those groans of agony which never escaped his lips by day,\n",
      "when they were compressed in silence over his inward woe.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many a time she sat up listening, and wondering if it would ease his miserable heart if she went\n",
      "to him, and told him she knew all, and loved and pitied him more than words could tell.</p>\n",
      "<p>By day the monotonous hours wore on in the same heavy, hushed manner as on that first dreary\n",
      "afternoon. He ate,—but without relish; and food seemed no longer to nourish him, for each morning\n",
      "his face had caught more of the ghastly fore-shadowing of Death.</p>\n",
      "<p>The neighbours kept strangely aloof. Of late years John Barton had had a repellent power about\n",
      "him, felt by all, except to the few who had either known him in his better and happier days, or\n",
      "those to whom he had given his sympathy and his confidence. People did not care to enter the doors\n",
      "of one whose very depth of thoughtfulness rendered him moody and stern. And now they contented\n",
      "themselves with a kind inquiry when they saw Mary in her goings-out or in her comings-in. With her\n",
      "oppressing knowledge, she imagined their reserved conduct stranger than it was in reality. She\n",
      "missed Job and Margaret too; who, in all former times of sorrow or anxiety since their acquaintance\n",
      "first began, had been ready with their sympathy.</p>\n",
      "<p>But most of all she missed the delicious luxury she had lately enjoyed in having Jem's tender\n",

      "thought.</p>\n",
      "<p>She knew he was often hovering about the house; though the knowledge seemed to come more by\n",
      "intuition, than by any positive sight or sound for the first day or two. On the third day she met\n",
      "him at Job Legh's.</p>\n",
      "<p>They received her with every effort of cordiality; but still there was a cobweb-veil of\n",
      "separation between them, to which Mary was morbidly acute; while in Jem's voice, and eyes, and\n",
      "manner, there was every evidence of most passionate, most admiring, and most trusting love. The\n",
      "trust was shown by his respectful silence on that one point of reserve on which she had interdicted\n",
      "conversation.</p>\n",
      "<p>He left Job Legh's house when she did. They lingered on the step, he holding her hand between\n",
      "both of his, as loth to let her go; he questioned her as to when he should see her again.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mother does so want to see you,\" whispered he. \"Can you come to see her to-morrow? or when?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I cannot tell,\" replied she, softly. \"Not yet. Wait awhile; perhaps only a little while. Dear\n",
      "Jem, I must go to him,—dearest Jem.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>The next day, the fourth from Mary's return home, as she was sitting near the window, sadly\n",
      "dreaming over some work, she caught a glimpse of the last person she wished to see—of Sally\n",
      "Leadbitter!</p>\n",
      "<p>She was evidently coming to their house; another moment, and she tapped at the door. John Barton\n",
      "gave an anxious, uneasy side-glance. Mary knew that if she delayed answering the knock, Sally would\n",
      "not scruple to enter; so as hastily as if the visit had been desired, she opened the door, and stood\n",
      "there with the latch in her hand, barring up all entrance, and as much as possible obstructing all\n",
      "curious glances into the interior.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Mary Barton! You're home at last! I heard you'd getten home; so I thought I'd just step\n",
      "over and hear the news.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>She was bent on coming in, and saw Mary's preventive design. So she stood on tip-toe, looking\n",
      "over Mary's shoulders into the room where she suspected a lover to be lurking; but instead, she saw\n",
      "only the figure of the stern, gloomy father she had always been in the habit of avoiding; and she\n",
      "dropped down again, content to carry on the conversation where Mary chose, and as Mary chose, in\n",
      "whispers.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"So the old governor is back again, eh? And what does he say to all your fine doings at\n",
      "Liverpool, and before?—you and I know where. You can't hide it now, Mary, for it's all in\n",
      "print.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary gave a low moan,—and then implored Sally to change the subject; for unpleasant as it always\n",
      "was, it was doubly unpleasant in the manner in which she was treating it. If they had been alone,\n",
      "Mary would have borne it patiently,—or so she thought,—but now she felt almost certain her father\n",
      "was listening; there was a subdued breathing, a slight bracing-up of the listless attitude. But\n",
      "there was no arresting Sally's curiosity to hear all she could respecting the adventures Mary had\n",
      "experienced. She, in common with the rest of Miss Simmonds' young ladies, was almost jealous of the\n",
      "fame that Mary had obtained; to herself, such miserable notoriety.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay! there's no use shunning talking it over. Why! it was in the <hi>Guardian</hi>,—and the\n",
      "<hi>Courier</hi>,—and some one told Jane Hodson it was even copied into a London paper. You've set\n",
      "up heroine on your own account, Mary Barton. How did you like standing witness? Ar'n't them lawyers\n",
      "impudent things? staring at one so. I'll be bound you wished you'd taken my offer, and borrowed my\n",
      "black watered scarf! Now didn't you, Mary? Speak truth!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To tell truth, I never thought about it then, Sally. How could I?\" asked she, reproachfully.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh—I forgot. You were all for that stupid James Wilson. Well! if I've ever the luck to go\n",
      "witness on a trial, see if I don't pick up a better beau than the prisoner. I'll aim at a lawyer's\n",
      "clerk, but I'll not take less than a turnkey.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Cast down as Mary was, she could hardly keep from smiling at the idea, so wildly incongruous with\n",
      "the scene she had really undergone, of looking out for admirers during a trial for murder.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'd no thought to be looking out for beaux, I can assure you, Sally.—But don't let us talk any\n",
      "more about it; I can't bear to think on it. How is Miss Simmonds? and everybody?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, very well; and by the way she gave me a bit of a message for you. You may come back to work\n",
      "if you'll behave yourself, she says. I told you she'd be glad to have you back, after all this piece\n",
      "of business, by way of tempting people to come to her shop. They'd come from Salford to have a peep\n",
      "at you, for six months at least.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Don't talk so; I cannot come, I can never face Miss Simmonds again. And even if I could—\" she\n",
      "stopped, and blushed.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! I know what you're thinking on. But that will not be this some time, as he's turned off from\n",
      "the foundry,—you'd better think twice afore refusing Miss Simmonds' offer.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Turned off from the foundry! Jem?\" cried Mary.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"To be sure! didn't you know it? Decent men were not going to work with a—no! I suppose I mustn't\n",
      "say it, seeing you went to such trouble to get up an <hi>alibi</hi>; not that I should think much\n",
      "the worse of a spirited young fellow for falling foul of a rival,—they always do at the\n",
      "theatre.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>But Mary's thoughts were with Jem. How good he had been never to name his dismissal to her. How\n",
      "much he had had to endure for her sake!</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tell me all about it,\" she gasped out.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Why, you see, they've always swords quite handy at them plays,\" began Sally; but Mary, with an\n",
      "impatient shake of her head, interrupted,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"About Jem,—about Jem, I want to know.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh! I don't pretend to know more than is in every one's mouth: he's turned away from the\n",
      "foundry, because folks don't think you've cleared him outright of the murder; though perhaps the\n",
      "jury were loth to hang him. Old Mr. Carson is savage against judge and jury, and lawyers and all, as\n",
      "I heard.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I must go to him, I must go to him,\" repeated Mary, in a hurried manner.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He'll tell you all I've said is true, and not a word of lie,\" replied Sally. \"So I'll not give\n",
      "your answer to Miss Simmonds, but leave you to think twice about it. Good afternoon!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mary shut the door, and turned into the house.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her father sat in the same attitude; the old unchanging attitude. Only his head was more bowed\n",
      "towards the ground.</p>\n",
      "<p>She put on her bonnet to go to Ancoats; for see, and question, and comfort, and worship Jem, she\n",
      "must.</p>\n",
      "<p>As she hung about her father for an instant before leaving him, he spoke—voluntarily spoke for\n",
      "the first time since her return; but his head was drooping so low she could not hear what he said,\n",
      "so she stooped down; and after a moment's pause, he repeated the words,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Tell Jem Wilson to come here at eight o'clock to-night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Could he have overheard her conversation with Sally Leadbitter? They had whispered low, she\n",

      "<p>\"Nay, darling! I'm not for blaming them. Poor fellows like them have nought to stand upon and be\n",

      "<p>But Mary could only shake her head in a mournful way, and repeat her words,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"They might have known thee better, Jem.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem pressed the little hand he held between his own work-hardened ones. After a minute or two, he\n",

      "<p>\"Mary, art thou much bound to Manchester? Would it grieve thee sore to quit the old\n",

      "<p>\"Ay, lass! Trust me, I'll ne'er ask thee to leave Manchester while I'm in it. Because I've heard\n",
      "fine things of Canada; and our overlooker has a cousin in the foundry line there.—Thou knowest where\n",
      "Canada is, Mary?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not rightly—not now, at any rate;—but with thee, Jem,\" her voice sunk to a soft, low whisper,\n",
      "\"anywhere—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>What was the use of a geographical description?</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But father!\" said Mary, suddenly breaking that delicious silence with the one sharp discord in\n",
      "her present life.</p>\n",
      "<p>She looked up at her lover's grave face; and then the message her father had sent flashed across\n",
      "her memory.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"I cannot tell,\" replied he. \"At any rate I'll go. It's no use troubling ourselves to guess,\" he\n",
      "continued, after a pause of a few minutes, during which they slowly and silently paced up and down\n",
      "the by-street, into which he had led her when their conversation began. \"Come and see mother, and\n",
      "then I'll take thee home, Mary. Thou wert all in a tremble when first I came up with thee; thou'rt\n",
      "not fit to be trusted home by thyself,\" said he, with fond exaggeration of her helplessness.</p>\n",
      "<p>Yet a little more lovers' loitering; a few more words, in themselves nothing—to you nothing, but\n",
      "to those two what tender passionate language can I use to express the feelings which thrilled\n",
      "through that young man and maiden, as they listened to the syllables made dear and lovely through\n",
      "life by that hour's low-whispered talk.</p>\n",

      "<p>So they went in. Jane Wilson was rather chafed at her son's delay in returning home, for as yet\n",

      "prepare some little pleasure, some little comfort for those she loved; and if they, unwittingly, did\n",
      "not appear at the proper time to enjoy her preparation, she worked herself up into a state of\n",
      "fretfulness which found vent in upbraidings as soon as ever the objects of her care appeared,\n",
      "thereby marring the peace which should ever be the atmosphere of a home, however humble; and causing\n",
      "a feeling almost amounting to loathing to arise at the sight of the \"stalled ox,\" which, though an\n",
      "effect and proof of careful love, has been the cause of so much disturbance.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Wilson had first sighed, and then grumbled to herself, over the increasing toughness of the\n",

      "<p>The door opened, and he came in; his face brightening into proud smiles, Mary Barton hanging on\n",
      "his arm, blushing and dimpling, with eye-lids veiling the happy light of her eyes,—there was around\n",
      "the young couple a radiant atmosphere—a glory of happiness.</p>\n",
      "<p>Could his mother mar it? Could she break into it with her Martha-like cares? Only for one moment\n",
      "did she remember her sense of injury,—her wasted trouble,—and then, her whole woman's heart heaving\n",
      "with motherly love and sympathy, she opened her arms, and received Mary into them, as, shedding\n",
      "tears of agitated joy, she murmured in her ear,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Bless thee, Mary, bless thee! Only make him happy, and God bless thee for ever!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It took some of Jem's self-command to separate those whom he so much loved, and who were\n",
      "beginning, for his sake, to love one another so dearly. But the time for his meeting John Barton\n",
      "drew on: and it was a long way to his house.</p>\n",
      "<p>As they walked briskly thither they hardly spoke; though many thoughts were in their minds.</p>\n",
      "<p>The sun had not long set, but the first faint shade of twilight was over all; and when they\n",

      "flickering fire-blaze.</p>\n",
      "<p>But Mary saw all at a glance!</p>\n",
      "<p>Her eye, accustomed to what was usual in the aspect of the room, saw instantly what was\n",
      "unusual,—saw, and understood it all.</p>\n",
      "<p>Her father was standing behind his habitual chair, holding by the back of it as if for support.\n",
      "And opposite to him there stood Mr. Carson; the dark out-line of his stern figure looming large\n",
      "against the light of the fire in that little room.</p>\n",
      "<p>Behind her father sat Job Legh, his head in his hands, and resting his elbows on the little\n",
      "family table,—listening evidently; but as evidently deeply affected by what he heard.</p>\n",
      "<p>There seemed to be some pause in the conversation. Mary and Jem stood at the half-open door, not\n",
      "daring to stir; hardly to breathe.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And have I heard you aright?\" began Mr. Carson, with his deep quivering voice. \"Man! have I\n",
      "heard you aright? Was it you, then, that killed my boy? my only son?\"—(he said these last few words\n",
      "almost as if appealing for pity, and then he changed his tone to one more vehement and fierce).\n",
      "\"Don't dare to think that I shall be merciful, and spare you, because you have come forward to\n",
      "accuse yourself. I tell you I will not spare you the least pang the law can inflict,—you, who did\n",
      "not show pity on my boy, shall have none from me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I did not ask for any,\" said John Barton, in a low voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ask, or not ask, what care I? You shall be hanged—hanged—man!\" said he, advancing his face, and\n",
      "repeating the word with slow, grinding emphasis, as if to infuse some of the bitterness of his soul\n",
      "into it.</p>\n",
      "<p>John Barton gasped, but not with fear. It was only that he felt it terrible to have inspired such\n",
      "hatred, as was concentrated into every word, every gesture of Mr. Carson's.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"As for being hanged, sir, I know it's all right and proper. I dare say it's bad enough; but I\n",
      "tell you what, sir,\" speaking with an out-burst, \"if you'd hanged me the day after I'd done the\n",
      "deed, I would have gone down on my knees and blessed you. Death! Lord, what is it to Life? To such a\n",
      "life as I've been leading this fortnight past. Life at best is no great thing; but such a life as I\n",
      "have dragged through since that night,\" he shuddered at the thought. \"Why, sir, I've been on the\n",
      "point of killing myself this many a time to get away from my own thoughts. I didn't! and I'll tell\n",

      "<p>Then he began again.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Sin' that day (it may be very wicked, sir, but it's the truth) I've kept thinking and thinking\n",

      "if it were with many stripes. I've been sore puzzled here. I would go through Hell-fire if I could\n",

      "<p>His exhaustion compelled him to sit down. Mary rushed to him. It seemed as if till then he had\n",

      "<p>Jem came forward. John Barton spoke again, with many a break and gasping pause,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Lad! thou hast borne a deal for me. It's the meanest thing I ever did to leave thee to bear the\n",
      "brunt. Thou, who wert as innocent of any knowledge of it as the babe unborn. I'll not bless thee for\n",
      "it. Blessing from such as me would not bring thee any good. Thou'lt love Mary, though she is my\n",
      "child.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He ceased, and there was a pause of a few seconds.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then Mr. Carson turned to go. When his hand was on the latch of the door, he hesitated for an\n",

      "<p>\"You can have no doubt for what purpose I go. Straight to the police-office, to send men to take\n",
      "care of you, wretched man, and your accomplice. To-morrow morning your tale shall be repeated to\n",
      "those who can commit you to gaol, and before long you shall have the opportunity of trying how\n",
      "desirable hanging is.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, sir!\" said Mary, springing forward, and catching hold of Mr. Carson's arm, \"my father is\n",
      "dying. Look at him, sir. If you want Death for Death, you have it. Don't take him away from me these\n",
      "last hours. He must go alone through Death, but let me be with him as long as I can. Oh, sir! if you\n",
      "have any mercy in you, leave him here to die.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>John himself stood up, stiff and rigid, and replied,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Mary, wench! I owe him summut. I will go die, where, and as he wishes me. Thou hast said true, I\n",
      "am standing side by side with Death; and it matters little where I spend the bit of time left of\n",
      "Life. That time I must pass in wrestling with my soul for a character to take into the other world.\n",
      "I'll go where you see fit, sir. He's innocent,\" faintly indicating Jem, as he fell back in his\n",
      "chair.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Never fear! They cannot touch him,\" said Job Legh, in a low voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>But as Mr. Carson was on the point of leaving the house with no sign of relenting about him, he\n",

      "himself on Jem, while he spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Sir, one word! My hairs are gray with suffering, and yours with years—\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And have I had no suffering?\" asked Mr. Carson, as if appealing for sympathy, even to the\n",
      "murderer of his child.</p>\n",
      "<p>And the murderer of his child answered to the appeal, and groaned in spirit over the anguish he\n",
      "had caused.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Have I had no inward suffering to blanch these hairs? Have not I toiled and struggled even to\n",
      "these years with hopes in my heart that all centered in my boy? I did not speak of them, but were\n",
      "they not there? I seemed hard and cold; and so I might be to others, but not to him!—who shall ever\n",
      "imagine the love I bore to him? Even he never dreamed how my heart leapt up at the sound of his\n",
      "footstep, and how precious he was to his poor old father.—And he is gone—killed—out of the hearing\n",
      "of all loving words—out of my sight for ever. He was my sunshine, and now it is night! Oh, my God!\n",
      "comfort me, comfort me!\" cried the old man aloud.</p>\n",
      "<p>The eyes of John Barton grew dim with tears. Rich and poor, masters and men, were then brothers\n",
      "in the deep suffering of the heart; for was not this the very anguish he had felt for little Tom, in\n",
      "years so long gone by that they seemed like another life!</p>\n",
      "<p>The mourner before him was no longer the employer; a being of another race, eternally placed in\n",
      "antagonistic attitude; going through the world glittering like gold, with a stony heart within,\n",
      "which knew no sorrow but through the accidents of Trade; no longer the enemy, the oppressor, but a\n",
      "very poor and desolate old man.</p>\n",
      "<p>The sympathy for suffering, formerly so prevalent a feeling with him, again filled John Barton's\n",
      "heart, and almost impelled him to speak (as best he could) some earnest, tender words to the stern\n",
      "man, shaking in his agony.</p>\n",
      "<p>But who was he, that he should utter sympathy or consolation? The cause of all this woe.</p>\n",
      "<p>Oh blasting thought! Oh miserable remembrance! He had forfeited all right to bind up his\n",
      "brother's wounds.</p>\n",
      "<p>Stunned by the thought, he sank upon the seat, almost crushed with the knowledge of the\n",
      "consequences of his own action; for he had no more imagined to himself the blighted home, and the\n",
      "miserable parents, than does the soldier, who discharges his musket, picture to himself the\n",
      "desolation of the wife, and the pitiful cries of the helpless little ones, who are in an instant to\n",
      "be made widowed and fatherless.</p>\n",
      "<p>To intimidate a class of men, known only to those below them as desirous to obtain the greatest\n",
      "quantity of work for the lowest wages,—at most to remove an overbearing partner from an obnoxious\n",
      "firm, who stood in the way of those who struggled as well as they were able to obtain their\n",
      "rights,—this was the light in which John Barton had viewed his deed; and even so viewing it, after\n",
      "the excitement had passed away, the Avenger, the sure Avenger, had found him out.</p>\n",
      "<p>But now he knew that he had killed a man, and a brother,—now he knew that no good thing could\n",
      "come out of this evil, even to the sufferers whose cause he had so blindly espoused.</p>\n",
      "<p>He lay across the table, broken-hearted. Every fresh quivering sob of Mr. Carson's stabbed him to\n",
      "his soul.</p>\n",
      "<p>He felt execrated by all; and as if he could never lay bare the perverted reasonings which had\n",
      "made the performance of undoubted sin appear a duty. The longing to plead some faint excuse grew\n",
      "stronger and stronger. He feebly raised his head, and looking at Job Legh, he whispered out,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I did not know what I was doing, Job Legh; God knows I didn't! Oh, sir!\" said he wildly, almost\n",
      "throwing himself at Mr. Carson's feet, \"say you forgive me the anguish I now see I have caused you.\n",
      "I care not for pain, or death, you know I don't; but oh, man! forgive me the trespass I have\n",
      "done!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us,\" said Job, solemnly and\n",
      "low, as if in prayer; as if the words were suggested by those John Barton had used.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson took his hands away from his face. I would rather see death than the ghastly gloom\n",
      "which darkened that countenance.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have vengeance for my son's murder.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There are blasphemous actions as well as blasphemous words: all unloving, cruel deeds are acted\n",
      "blasphemy.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson left the house. And John Barton lay on the ground as one dead.</p>\n",
      "<p>They lifted him up, and almost hoping that that deep trance might be to him the end of all\n",
      "earthly things, they bore him to his bed.</p>\n",
      "<p>For a time they listened with divided attention to his faint breathings; for in each hasty\n",
      "hurried step that echoed in the street outside, they thought they heard the approach of the officers\n",
      "of justice.</p>\n",
      "<p>When Mr. Carson left the house he was dizzy with agitation; the hot blood went careering through\n",
      "his frame. He could not see the deep blue of the night-heavens for the fierce pulses which throbbed\n",
      "in his head. And partly to steady and calm himself, he leaned against a railing, and looked up into\n",
      "those calm majestic depths with all their thousand stars.</p>\n",
      "<p>And by-and-by his own voice returned upon him, as if the last words he had spoken were being\n",
      "uttered through all that infinite space; but in their echoes there was a tone of unutterable\n",
      "sorrow.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Let my trespasses be unforgiven, so that I may have vengeance for my son's murder.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>He tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this imagination. He was feverish and\n",
      "ill,—and no wonder.</p>\n",
      "<p>So he turned to go homewards; not, as he had threatened, to the police-office. After all (he told\n",
      "himself), that would do in the morning. No fear of the man's escaping, unless he escaped to the\n",
      "grave.</p>\n",
      "<p>So he tried to banish the phantom voices and shapes which came unbidden to his brain, and to\n",
      "recall his balance of mind by walking calmly and slowly, and noticing every thing which struck his\n",
      "senses.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was a warm soft evening in spring, and there were many persons in the streets. Among others, a\n",

      "likely, for the lovely little creature was daintily decked out in soft, snowy muslin; and her fairy\n",

      "to.</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly up behind her there came a rough, rude errand-boy, nine or ten years of age; a giant he\n",
      "looked by the fairy-child, as she fluttered along. I don't know how it was, but in some awkward way\n",
      "he knocked the poor little girl down upon the hard pavement as he brushed rudely past, not much\n",
      "caring whom he hurt, so that he got along.</p>\n",
      "<p>The child arose sobbing with pain; and not without cause, for blood was dropping down from the\n",
      "face, but a minute before so fair and bright—dropping down on the pretty frock, making those scarlet\n",
      "marks so terrible to little children.</p>\n",
      "<p>The nurse, a powerful woman, had seized the boy, just as Mr. Carson (who had seen the whole\n",
      "transaction) came up.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You naughty little rascal! I'll give you to a policeman, that I will! Do you see how you've hurt\n",
      "the little girl? Do you?\" accompanying every sentence with a violent jerk of passionate anger.</p>\n",
      "<p>The lad looked hard and defying; but withal terrified at the threat of the policeman, those ogres\n",
      "of our streets to all unlucky urchins. The nurse saw it, and began to drag him along, with a view of\n",
      "making what she called \"a wholesome impression.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>His terror increased, and with it his irritation; when the little sweet face, choking away its\n",
      "sobs, pulled down nurse's head and said,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Please, dear nurse, I'm not much hurt; it was very silly to cry, you know. He did not mean to do\n",
      "it. <hi>He did not know what he was doing</hi>, did you, little boy? Nurse won't call a policeman,\n",
      "so don't be frightened.\" And she put up her little mouth to be kissed by her injurer, just as she\n",
      "had been taught to do at home to \"make peace.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That lad will mind, and be more gentle for the time to come, I'll be bound, thanks to that\n",
      "little lady,\" said a passer-by, half to himself, and half to Mr. Carson, whom he had observed to\n",
      "notice the scene.</p>\n",
      "<p>The latter took no apparent heed of the remark, but passed on. But the child's pleading reminded\n",
      "him of the low, broken voice he had so lately heard, penitently and humbly urging the same\n",
      "extenuation of his great guilt.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I did not know what I was doing.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>He laid his head down on the open page, and let the tears fall slowly on the spotless leaves.</p>\n",
      "<p>His son's murderer was discovered; had confessed his guilt; and yet (strange to say) he could not\n",
      "hate him with the vehemence of hatred he had felt, when he had imagined him a young man, full of\n",

      "that night.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the days of his childhood and youth, Mr. Carson had been accustomed to poverty; but it was\n",
      "honest, decent poverty; not the grinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of John\n",
      "Barton's house, and which contrasted strangely with the pompous sumptuousness of the room in which\n",
      "he now sat. Unaccustomed wonder filled his mind at the reflection of the different lots of the\n",
      "brethren of mankind.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then he roused himself from his reverie, and turned to the object of his search—the Gospel, where\n",
      "he half expected to find the tender pleading: \"They know not what they do.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It was murk midnight by this time, and the house was still and quiet. There was nothing to\n",
      "interrupt the old man in his unwonted study.</p>\n",
      "<p>Years ago, the Gospel had been his task-book in learning to read. So many years ago, that he had\n",
      "become familiar with the events before he could comprehend the Spirit that made the Life.</p>\n",
      "<p>He fell to the narrative now afresh, with all the interest of a little child. He began at the\n",
      "beginning, and read on almost greedily, understanding for the first time the full meaning of the\n",
      "story. He came to the end; the awful End. And there were the haunting words of pleading.</p>\n",
      "<p>He shut the book, and thought deeply.</p>\n",
      "<p>All night long, the Archangel combated with the Demon.</p>\n",
      "<p>All night long, others watched by the bed of Death. John Barton had revived to fitful\n",
      "intelligence. He spoke at times with even something of his former energy; and in the racy Lancashire\n",

      "<p>\"You see I've so often been hankering after the right way; and it's a hard one for a poor man to\n",
      "find. At least it's been so to me. No one learned me, and no one telled me. When I was a little chap\n",
      "they taught me to read, and then they ne'er gave me no books; only I heard say the Bible was a good\n",
      "book. So when I grew thoughtful, and puzzled, I took to it. But you'd never believe black was black,\n",
      "or night was night, when you saw all about you acting as if black was white, and night was day. It's\n",
      "not much I can say for myself in t'other world, God forgive me; but I can say this, I would fain\n",
      "have gone after the Bible rules if I'd seen folk credit it; they all spoke up for it, and went and\n",
      "did clean contrary. In those days I would ha' gone about wi' my Bible, like a little child, my\n",
      "finger in th' place, and asking the meaning of this or that text, and no one told me. Then I took\n",
      "out two or three texts as clear as glass, and I tried to do what they bid me do. But I don't know\n",
      "how it was; masters and men, all alike cared no more for minding those texts, than I did for th'\n",

      "<p>A step, which was not Jem's, came up the stairs.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson stood in the door-way. In one instant he comprehended the case.</p>\n",
      "<p>He raised up the powerless frame; and the departing soul looked out of the eyes with gratitude.\n",
      "He held the dying man propped in his arms. John Barton folded his hands as if in prayer.</p>\n",

      "<p>The day brought its burden of duty to Mrs. Wilson. She felt bound by regard, as well as by\n",
      "etiquette, to go and see her future daughter-in-law. And by an old association of ideas (perhaps of\n",
      "death with church-yards, and churches with Sunday) she thought it necessary to put on her best, and\n",
      "latterly unused clothes, the airing of which on a little clothes-horse before the fire seemed to\n",
      "give her a not unpleasing occupation.</p>\n",
      "<p>When Jem returned home late in the evening succeeding John Barton's death, weary and oppressed\n",
      "with the occurrences and excitements of the day, he found his mother busy about her mourning, and\n",
      "much inclined to talk. Although he longed for quiet, he could not avoid sitting down and answering\n",
      "her questions.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, Jem, he's gone at last, is he?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes. How did you hear, mother?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, Job came over here and telled me, on his way to the undertaker's. Did he make a fine\n",
      "end?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>It struck Jem that she had not heard of the confession which had been made by John Barton on his\n",
      "death-bed; he remembered Job Legh's discretion, and he determined that if it could be avoided his\n",
      "mother should never hear of it. Many of the difficulties to be anticipated in preserving the secret\n",
      "would be obviated, if he could induce his mother to fall into the plan he had named to Mary of\n",
      "emigrating to Canada. The reasons which rendered this secrecy desirable related to the domestic\n",
      "happiness he hoped for. With his mother's irritable temper he could hardly expect that all allusion\n",
      "to the crime of John Barton would be for ever restrained from passing her lips, and he knew the deep\n",
      "trial such references would be to Mary. Accordingly he resolved as soon as possible in the morning\n",
      "to go to Job and beseech his silence; he trusted that secrecy in that quarter, even if the knowledge\n",
      "had been extended to Margaret, might be easily secured.</p>\n",
      "<p>But what would be Mr. Carson's course? Were there any means by which he might be persuaded to\n",
      "spare John Barton's memory?</p>\n",
      "<p>He was roused up from this train of thought by his mother's more irritated tone of voice.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Jem!\" she was saying, \"thou might'st just as well never be at a death-bed again, if thou cannot\n",
      "bring off more news about it; here have I been by mysel all day (except when oud Job came in), but\n",
      "thinks I, when Jem comes he'll be sure to be good company, seeing he was in the house at the very\n",
      "time of the death; and here thou art, without a word to throw at a dog, much less thy mother: it's\n",
      "no use thy going to a death-bed if thou cannot carry away any of the sayings!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He did not make any, mother,\" replied Jem.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, to be sure! So fond as he used to be of holding forth, to miss such a fine opportunity\n",
      "that will never come again! Did he die easy?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"He was very restless all night long,\" said Jem, reluctantly returning to the thoughts of that\n",
      "time.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And in course thou plucked the pillow away? Thou didst not! Well! with thy bringing up, and thy\n",
      "learning, thou might'st have known that were the only help in such a case. There were pigeons'\n",
      "feathers in the pillow, depend on't. To think of two grown-up folk like you and Mary, not knowing\n",
      "death could never come easy to a person lying on a pillow with pigeons' feathers in!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem was glad to escape from all this talking to the solitude and quiet of his own room, where he\n",
      "could lie and think uninterruptedly of what had happened and remained to be done.</p>\n",
      "<p>The first thing was to seek an interview with Mr. Duncombe, his former master. Accordingly, early\n",
      "the next morning Jem set off on his walk to the works, where for so many years his days had been\n",
      "spent; where for so long a time his thoughts had been thought, his hopes and fears experienced. It\n",
      "was not a cheering feeling to remember that henceforward he was to be severed from all these\n",
      "familiar places; nor were his spirits enlivened by the evident feelings of the majority of those who\n",
      "had been his fellow-workmen. As he stood in the entrance to the foundry, awaiting Mr. Duncombe's\n",
      "leisure, many of those employed in the works passed him on their return from breakfast; and with one\n",
      "or two exceptions, without any acknowledgment of former acquaintance beyond a distant nod at the\n",
      "utmost.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It is hard,\" said Jem to himself, with a bitter and indignant feeling rising in his throat,\n",
      "\"that let a man's life be what it may, folk are so ready to credit the first word against him. I\n",
      "could live it down if I stayed in England; but then what would not Mary have to bear? Sooner or\n",
      "later the truth would out; and then she would be a show to folk for many a day as John Barton's\n",
      "daughter. Well! God does not judge as hardly as man, that's one comfort for all of us!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Duncombe did not believe in Jem's guilt, in spite of the silence in which he again this day\n",
      "heard the imputation of it; but he agreed that under the circumstances it was better he should leave\n",
      "the country.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"We have been written to by government, as I think I told you before, to recommend an intelligent\n",
      "man, well acquainted with mechanics, as instrument-maker to the Agricultural College they are\n",
      "establishing at Toronto, in Canada. It is a comfortable appointment,—house,—land,—and a good\n",
      "per-centage on the instruments made. I will show you the particulars if I can lay my hand on the\n",
      "letter, which I believe I must have left at home.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thank you, sir. No need for seeing the letter to say I'll accept it. I must leave Manchester;\n",
      "and I'd as lief quit England at once when I'm about it.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Of course government will give you your passage; indeed, I believe an allowance would be made\n",
      "for a family if you had one; but you are not a married man, I believe?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, sir, but—\" Jem hung back from a confession with the awkwardness of a girl.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"But—\" said Mr. Duncombe, smiling, \"you would like to be a married man before you go, I suppose;\n",
      "eh, Wilson?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"If you please, sir. And there's my mother, too. I hope she'll go with us. But I can pay her\n",
      "passage; no need to trouble government.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Nay, nay! I'll write to-day and recommend you; and say that you have a family of two. They'll\n",
      "never ask if the family goes upwards or downwards. I shall see you again before you sail, I hope,\n",
      "Wilson; though I believe they'll not allow you long to wait. Come to my house next time; you'll find\n",
      "it pleasanter, I daresay. These men are so wrong-headed. Keep up your heart!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem felt that it was a relief to have this point settled; and that he need no longer weigh\n",
      "reasons for and against his emigration.</p>\n",
      "<p>And with his path growing clearer and clearer before him the longer he contemplated it, he went\n",
      "to see Mary, and if he judged it fit, to tell her what he had decided upon. Margaret was sitting\n",
      "with her.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Grandfather wants to see you!\" said she to Jem on his entrance.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And I want to see him,\" replied Jem, suddenly remembering his last night's determination to\n",
      "enjoin secrecy on Job Legh.</p>\n",
      "<p>So he hardly stayed to kiss poor Mary's sweet woe-begone face, but tore himself away from his\n",
      "darling to go to the old man, who awaited him impatiently.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I've getten a note from Mr. Carson,\" exclaimed Job the moment he saw Jem; \"and man-alive, he\n",
      "wants to see thee and me! For sure, there's no more mischief up, is there?\" said he, looking at Jem\n",
      "with an expression of wonder. But if any suspicion mingled for an instant with the thoughts that\n",
      "crossed Job's mind, it was immediately dispelled by Jem's honest, fearless, open countenance.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I can't guess what he's wanting, poor old chap,\" answered he. \"May be there's some point he's\n",
      "not yet satisfied on; may be—but it's no use guessing; let's be off.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It wouldn't be better for thee to be scarce a bit, would it, and leave me to go and find out\n",
      "what's up? He has, perhaps, getten some crotchet into his head thou'rt an accomplice, and is laying\n",
      "a trap for thee.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm not afeared!\" said Jem; \"I've done nought wrong, and know nought wrong, about yon poor dead\n",
      "lad; though I'll own I had evil thoughts once on a time. Folk can't mistake long if once they'll\n",
      "search into the truth. I'll go and give the old gentleman all the satisfaction in my power, now it\n",
      "can injure no one. I'd my own reasons for wanting to see him besides, and it all falls in right\n",
      "enough for me.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job was a little reassured by Jem's boldness; but still, if the truth must be told, he wished the\n",
      "young man would follow his advice, and leave him to sound Mr. Carson's intentions.</p>\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile Jane Wilson had donned her Sunday suit of black, and set off on her errand of\n",
      "condolence. She felt nervous and uneasy at the idea of the moral sayings and texts which she fancied\n",
      "were expected from visitors on occasions like the present; and prepared many a good set speech as\n",
      "she walked towards the house of mourning.</p>\n",
      "<p>As she gently opened the door, Mary, sitting idly by the fire, caught a glimpse of her,—of Jem's\n",
      "mother,—of the early friend of her dead parents,—of the kind minister to many a little want in days\n",
      "of childhood,—and rose and came and fell about her neck, with many a sob and moan, saying,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Oh, he's gone—he's dead—all gone—all dead, and I am left alone!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Poor wench! poor, poor wench!\" said Jane Wilson, tenderly kissing her. \"Thou'rt not alone, so\n",
      "donnot take on so. I'll say nought of Him who's above, for thou know'st He is ever the orphan's\n",
      "friend; but think on Jem! nay, Mary, dear, think on me! I'm but a frabbit woman at times, but I've a\n",
      "heart within me through all my temper, and thou shalt be as a daughter henceforward,—as mine own\n",
      "ewe-lamb. Jem shall not love thee better in his way, than I will in mine; and thou'lt bear with my\n",
      "turns, Mary, knowing that in my soul God sees the love that shall ever be thine, if thou'lt take me\n",
      "for thy mother, and speak no more of being alone.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mrs. Wilson was weeping herself long before she had ended this speech, which was so different to\n",
      "all she had planned to say, and from all the formal piety she had laid in store for the visit; for\n",
      "this was heart's piety, and needed no garnish of texts to make it true religion, pure and\n",
      "undefiled.</p>\n",
      "<p>They sat together on the same chair, their arms encircling each other; they wept for the same\n",
      "dead; they had the same hope, and trust, and overflowing love in the living.</p>\n",
      "<p>From that time forward, hardly a passing cloud dimmed the happy confidence of their intercourse;\n",
      "even by Jem would his mother's temper sooner be irritated than by Mary; before the latter she\n",
      "repressed her occasional nervous ill-humour till the habit of indulging it was perceptibly\n",
      "decreased.</p>\n",
      "<p>Years afterwards in conversation with Jem, he was startled by a chance expression which dropped\n",
      "from his mother's lips; it implied a knowledge of John Barton's crime. It was many a long day since\n",
      "they had seen any Manchester people who could have revealed the secret (if indeed it was known in\n",
      "Manchester, against which Jem had guarded in every possible way). And he was led to inquire first as\n",
      "to the extent, and then as to the source of her knowledge. It was Mary herself who had told all.</p>\n",
      "<p>For on the morning to which this chapter principally relates, as Mary sat weeping, and as Mrs.\n",
      "Wilson comforted her by every tenderest word and caress, she revealed to the dismayed and astonished\n",
      "Jane, the sting of her deep sorrow; the crime which stained her dead father's memory.</p>\n",
      "<p>She was quite unconscious that Jem had kept it secret from his mother; she had imagined it\n",
      "bruited abroad as the suspicion against her lover had been; so word after word (dropped from her\n",
      "lips in the supposition that Mrs. Wilson knew all) had told the tale and revealed the cause of her\n",
      "deep anguish; deeper than is ever caused by Death alone.</p>\n",
      "<p>On large occasions like the present, Mrs. Wilson's innate generosity came out. Her weak and\n",
      "ailing frame imparted its irritation to her conduct in small things, and daily trifles; but she had\n",
      "deep and noble sympathy with great sorrows, and even at the time that Mary spoke she allowed no\n",
      "expression of surprise or horror to escape her lips. She gave way to no curiosity as to the untold\n",
      "details; she was as secret and trustworthy as her son himself; and if in years to come her anger was\n",
      "occasionally excited against Mary, and she, on rare occasions, yielded to ill-temper against her\n",
      "daughter-in-law, she would upbraid her for extravagance, or stinginess, or over-dressing, or\n",
      "under-dressing, or too much mirth or too much gloom, but never, never in her most uncontrolled\n",
      "moments did she allude to any one of the circumstances relating to Mary's flirtation with Harry\n",
      "Carson, or his murderer; and always when she spoke of John Barton, named him with the respect due to\n",
      "his conduct before the last, miserable, guilty month of his life.</p>\n",
      "<p>Therefore it came like a blow to Jem when, after years had passed away, he gathered his mother's\n",
      "knowledge of the whole affair. From the day when he learnt (not without remorse) what hidden depths\n",
      "of self-restraint she had in her soul, his manner to her, always tender and respectful, became\n",
      "reverential; and it was more than ever a loving strife between him and Mary which should most\n",
      "contribute towards the happiness of the declining years of their mother.</p>\n",

      "glasses to his eyes, \"whether you, Wilson, can explain how Barton came possessed of your gun. I\n",

      "telling aught. To you, sir, now I will tell every thing and any thing; only it is but little. The\n",
      "gun was my father's before it was mine, and long ago he and John Barton had a fancy for shooting at\n",

      "<p>Jem saw with self-upbraiding pain how Mr. Carson winced at these last words, but at each\n",

      "<p>\"One day in the week—I think it was on the Wednesday,—yes, it was,—it was on St. Patrick's day, I\n",
      "met John just coming out of our house, as I were going to my dinner. Mother was out, and he'd found\n",
      "no one in. He said he'd come to borrow the old gun, and that he'd have made bold, and taken it, but\n",
      "it was not to be seen. Mother was afraid of it, so after father's death (for while he were alive,\n",
      "she seemed to think he could manage it) I had carried it to my own room. I went up and fetched it\n",
      "for John, who stood outside the door all the time.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What did he say he wanted it for?\" asked Mr. Carson, hastily.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I don't think he spoke when I gave it him. At first he muttered something about the\n",
      "shooting-gallery, and I never doubted but that it were for practice there, as I knew he had done\n",
      "years before.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Mr. Carson had strung up his frame to an attitude of upright attention while Jem was speaking;\n",
      "now the tension relaxed, and he sank back in his chair, weak and powerless.</p>\n",
      "<p>He rose up again, however, as Jem went on, anxious to give every particular which could satisfy\n",
      "the bereaved father.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I never knew for what he wanted the gun till I was taken up,—I do not know yet why he wanted it.\n",
      "No one would have had me get out of the scrape by implicating an old friend,—my father's old friend,\n",
      "and the father of the girl I loved. So I refused to tell Mr. Bridgenorth aught about it, and would\n",
      "not have named it now to any one but you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem's face became very red at the allusion he made to Mary, but his honest, fearless eyes had met\n",
      "Mr. Carson's penetrating gaze unflinchingly, and had carried conviction of his innocence and\n",
      "truthfulness. Mr. Carson felt certain that he had heard all that Jem could tell. Accordingly he\n",

      "<p>\"You were in the room the whole time while Barton was speaking to me, I think?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Yes, sir,\" answered Job.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You'll excuse my asking plain and direct questions; the information I am gaining is really a\n",

      "guilt in this matter before?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"None whatever, so help me God!\" said Job, solemnly. \"To tell truth (and axing your forgiveness,\n",
      "Jem), I had never got quite shut of the notion that Jem here had done it. At times I was as clear of\n",
      "his innocence as I was of my own; and whenever I took to reasoning about it, I saw he could not have\n",
      "been the man that did it. Still I never thought of Barton.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"And yet by his confession he must have been absent at the time,\" said Mr. Carson, referring to\n",
      "his slip of paper.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay, and for many a day after,—I can't rightly say how long. But still, you see, one's often\n",
      "blind to many a thing that lies right under one's nose, till it's pointed out. And till I heard what\n",
      "John Barton had to say yon night, I could not have seen what reason he had for doing it; while in\n",
      "the case of Jem, any one who looked at Mary Barton might have seen a cause for jealousy, clear\n",
      "enough.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Then you believe that Barton had no knowledge of my son's unfortunate,—\" he looked at Jem, \"of\n",
      "his attentions to Mary Barton. This young man, Wilson, had heard of them, you see.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"The person who told me said clearly she neither had, nor would tell Mary's father,\" interposed\n",
      "Jem. \"I don't believe he'd ever heard of it; he weren't a man to keep still in such a matter, if he\n",
      "had.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Besides,\" said Job, \"the reason he gave on his death-bed, so to speak, was enough; 'specially to\n",
      "those who knew him.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You mean his feelings regarding the treatment of the workmen by the masters; you think he acted\n",
      "from motives of revenge, in consequence of the part my son had taken in putting down the\n",
      "strike?\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Well, sir,\" replied Job, \"it's hard to say: John Barton was not a man to take counsel with\n",
      "people; nor did he make many words about his doings. So I can only judge from his way of thinking\n",
      "and talking in general, never having heard him breathe a syllable concerning this matter in\n",
      "particular. You see he were sadly put about to make great riches and great poverty square with\n",
      "Christ's Gospel\"—Job paused, in order to try and express what was clear enough in his own mind, as\n",
      "to the effect produced on John Barton by the great and mocking contrasts presented by the varieties\n",
      "of human condition. Before he could find suitable words to explain his meaning, Mr. Carson\n",
      "spoke.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You mean he was an Owenite; all for equality and community of goods, and that kind of\n",
      "absurdity.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"No, no! John Barton was no fool. No need to tell him that were all men equal to-night, some\n",
      "would get the start by rising an hour earlier to-morrow. Nor yet did he care for goods, nor\n",
      "wealth—no man less, so that he could get daily bread for him and his; but what hurt him sore, and\n",
      "rankled in him as long as I knew him (and, sir, it rankles in many a poor man's heart far more than\n",
      "the want of any creature-comforts, and puts a sting into starvation itself), was that those who wore\n",
      "finer clothes, and eat better food, and had more money in their pockets, kept him at arm's length,\n",
      "and cared not whether his heart was sorry or glad; whether he lived or died,—whether he was bound\n",
      "for heaven or hell. It seemed hard to him that a heap of gold should part him and his brother so far\n",
      "asunder. For he was a loving man before he grew mad with seeing such as he was slighted, as if\n",
      "Christ Himself had not been poor. At one time, I've heard him say, he felt kindly towards every man,\n",
      "rich or poor, because he thought they were all men alike. But latterly he grew aggravated with the\n",
      "sorrows and suffering that he saw, and which he thought the masters might help if they would.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"That's the notion you've all of you got,\" said Mr. Carson. \"Now, how in the world can we help\n",
      "it? We cannot regulate the demand for labour. No man or set of men can do it. It depends on events\n",
      "which God alone can control. When there is no market for our goods, we suffer just as much as you\n",
      "can do.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Not as much, I'm sure, sir; though I'm not given to Political Economy, I know that much. I'm\n",
      "wanting in learning, I'm aware; but I can use my eyes. I never see the masters getting thin and\n",
      "haggard for want of food; I hardly ever see them making much change in their way of living, though I\n",
      "don't doubt they've got to do it in bad times. But it's in things for show they cut short; while for\n",
      "such as me, it's in things for life we've to stint. For sure, sir, you'll own it's come to a hard\n",
      "pass when a man would give aught in the world for work to keep his children from starving, and can't\n",
      "get a bit, if he's ever so willing to labour. I'm not up to talking as John Barton would have done,\n",
      "but that's clear to me at any rate.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"My good man, just listen to me. Two men live in solitude; one produces loaves of bread, the\n",
      "other coats,—or what you will. Now, would it not be hard if the bread-producer were forced to give\n",
      "bread for the coats, whether he wanted them or not, in order to furnish employment to the other?\n",
      "That is the simple form of the case; you've only to multiply the numbers. There will come times of\n",
      "great changes in the occupation of thousands, when improvements in manufactures and machinery are\n",
      "made.—It's all nonsense talking,—it must be so!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job Legh pondered a few moments.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It's true it was a sore time for the hand-loom weavers when power-looms came in: them\n",
      "new-fangled things make a man's life like a lottery; and yet I'll never misdoubt that power-looms,\n",
      "and railways, and all such-like inventions, are the gifts of God. I have lived long enough, too, to\n",
      "see that it is part of His plan to send suffering to bring out a higher good; but surely it's also\n",
      "part of His plan that as much of the burden of the suffering as can be, should be lightened by those\n",
      "whom it is His pleasure to make happy, and content in their own circumstances. Of course it would\n",
      "take a deal more thought and wisdom than me, or any other man has, to settle out of hand how this\n",
      "should be done. But I'm clear about this, when God gives a blessing to be enjoyed, He gives it with\n",
      "a duty to be done; and the duty of the happy is to help the suffering to bear their woe.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Still, facts have proved and are daily proving how much better it is for every man to be\n",
      "independent of help, and self-reliant,\" said Mr. Carson, thoughtfully.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"You can never work facts as you would fixed quantities, and say, given two facts, and the\n",
      "product is so and so. God has given men feelings and passions which cannot be worked into the\n",
      "problem, because they are for ever changing and uncertain. God has also made some weak; not in any\n",
      "one way, but in all. One is weak in body, another in mind, another in steadiness of purpose, a\n",
      "fourth can't tell right from wrong, and so on; or if he can tell the right, he wants strength to\n",
      "hold by it. Now to my thinking, them that is strong in any of God's gifts is meant to help the\n",
      "weak,—be hanged to the facts! I ask your pardon, sir; I can't rightly explain the meaning that is in\n",
      "me. I'm like a tap as won't run, but keeps letting it out drop by drop, so that you've no notion of\n",
      "the force of what's within.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Job looked and felt very sorrowful at the want of power in his words, while the feeling within\n",
      "him was so strong and clear.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"What you say is very true, no doubt,\" replied Mr. Carson; \"but how would you bring it to bear\n",
      "upon the masters' conduct,—on my particular case?\" added he, gravely.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm not learned enough to argue. Thoughts come into my head that I'm sure are as true as Gospel,\n",
      "though may be they don't follow each other like the Q. E. D. of a Proposition. The masters has it on\n",
      "their own conscience,—you have it on yours, sir, to answer for to God whether you've done, and are\n",
      "doing all in your power to lighten the evils that seem always to hang on the trades by which you\n",
      "make your fortunes. It's no business of mine, thank God. John Barton took the question in hand, and\n",
      "his answer to it was <hi>no</hi>! Then he grew bitter, and angry, and mad; and in his madness he did\n",
      "a great sin, and wrought a great woe; and repented him with tears as of blood; and will go through\n",
      "his penance humbly and meekly in t'other place, I'll be bound. I never seed such bitter repentance\n",
      "as his that last night.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>There was a silence of many minutes. Mr. Carson had covered his face, and seemed utterly\n",
      "forgetful of their presence; and yet they did not like to disturb him by rising to leave the\n",
      "room.</p>\n",
      "<p>At last he said, without meeting their sympathetic eyes,</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Thank you both for coming,—and for speaking candidly to me. I fear, Legh, neither you nor I have\n",
      "convinced each other, as to the power, or want of power, in the masters to remedy the evils the men\n",
      "complain of.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I'm loth to vex you, sir, just now; but it was not the want of power I was talking on; what we\n",
      "all feel sharpest is the want of inclination to try and help the evils which come like blights at\n",
      "times over the manufacturing places, while we see the masters can stop work and not suffer. If we\n",
      "saw the masters try for our sakes to find a remedy,—even if they were long about it,—even if they\n",
      "could find no help, and at the end of all could only say, 'Poor fellows, our hearts are sore for ye;\n",
      "we've done all we could, and can't find a cure,'—we'd bear up like men through bad times. No one\n",
      "knows till they've tried, what power of bearing lies in them, if once they believe that men are\n",
      "caring for their sorrows and will help if they can. If fellow-creatures can give nought but tears\n",
      "and brave words, we take our trials straight from God, and we know enough of His love to put\n",
      "ourselves blind into His hands. You say our talk has done no good. I say it has. I see the view you\n",
      "take of things from the place where you stand. I can remember that, when the time comes for judging\n",
      "you; I sha'n't think any longer, does he act right on my views of a thing, but does he act right on\n",
      "his own. It has done me good in that way. I'm an old man, and may never see you again; but I'll pray\n",
      "for you, and think on you and your trials, both of your great wealth, and of your son's cruel death,\n",
      "many and many a day to come; and I'll ask God to bless both to you now and for evermore. Amen.\n",
      "Farewell!\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Jem had maintained a manly and dignified reserve ever since he had made his open statement of all\n",
      "he knew. Now both the men rose and bowed low, looking at Mr. Carson with the deep human interest\n",
      "they could not fail to take in one who had endured and forgiven a deep injury; and who struggled\n",
      "hard, as it was evident he did, to bear up like a man under his affliction.</p>\n",
      "<p>He bowed low in return to them. Then he suddenly came forward and shook them by the hand; and\n",

      "into a searching inquiry into the nature of their calamity, and the remedy (if remedy there be)\n",

      "from the actions he performed; for the character is more easily changed than the habits and manners\n",

      "can't make it out.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>\"Your poor aunt Esther has no home:—she's one of them miserable creatures that walk the streets.\"\n",

      "how can I make her come with me? Once before she refused, and said she could not break off her\n",

      "before he went out.</p>\n",
      "<p>It was not to be. Jem wandered far and wide that night, but never met Esther. The next day he\n",
      "applied to the police; and at last they recognised under his description of her, a woman known to\n",
      "them under the name of the \"Butterfly,\" from the gaiety of her dress a year or two ago. By their\n",
      "help he traced out one of her haunts, a low lodging-house behind Peter Street. He and his companion,\n",
      "a kind-hearted policeman, were admitted, suspiciously enough, by the landlady, who ushered them into\n",
      "a large garret where twenty or thirty people of all ages and both sexes lay and dozed away the day,\n",
      "choosing the evening and night for their trades of beggary, thieving, or prostitution.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"I know the Butterfly was here,\" said she, looking round. \"She came in, the night before last,\n",
      "and said she had not a penny to get a place for shelter; and that if she was far away in the country\n",
      "she could steal aside and die in a copse, or a clough, like the wild animals; but here the police\n",
      "would let no one alone in the streets, and she wanted a spot to die in, in peace. It's a queer sort\n",
      "of peace we have here, but that night the room was uncommon empty, and I'm not a hard-hearted woman\n",
      "(I wish I were, I could ha' made a good thing out of it afore this if I were harder), so I sent her\n",
      "up,—but she's not here now, I think.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Was she very bad?\" asked Jem.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"Ay! nought but skin and bone, with a cough to tear her in two.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>They made some inquiries, and found that in the restlessness of approaching death, she had longed\n",
      "to be once more in the open air, and had gone forth,—where, no one seemed to be able to tell.</p>\n",
      "<p>Leaving many messages for her, and directions that he was to be sent for if either the policeman\n",
      "or the landlady obtained any clue to her where-abouts, Jem bent his steps towards Mary's house; for\n",
      "he had not seen her all that long day of search. He told her of his proceedings and want of success;\n",
      "and both were saddened at the recital, and sat silent for some time.</p>\n",
      "<p>After a while they began talking over their plans. In a day or two, Mary was to give up house,\n",
      "and go and live for a week or so with Job Legh, until the time of her marriage, which would take\n",
      "place immediately before sailing; they talked themselves back into silence and delicious reverie.\n",
      "Mary sat by Jem, his arm round her waist, her head on his shoulder; and thought over the scenes\n",
      "which had passed in that home she was so soon to leave for ever.</p>\n",
      "<p>Suddenly she felt Jem start, and started too without knowing why; she tried to see his\n",
      "countenance, but the shades of evening had deepened so much she could read no expression there. It\n",
      "was turned to the window; she looked and saw a white face pressed against the panes on the outside,\n",
      "gazing intently into the dusky chamber.</p>\n",
      "<p>While they watched, as if fascinated by the appearance, and unable to think or stir, a film came\n",

      "struggle of instinctive resistance.</p>\n",
      "<p>\"It is Esther!\" exclaimed they, both at once. They rushed outside; and, fallen into what appeared\n",
      "simply a heap of white or light-coloured clothes, fainting or dead, lay the poor crushed\n",
      "Butterfly—the once innocent Esther.</p>\n",
      "<p>She had come (as a wounded deer drags its heavy limbs once more to the green coolness of the lair\n",
      "in which it was born, there to die) to see the place familiar to her innocence, yet once again\n",
      "before her death. Whether she was indeed alive or dead, they knew not now.</p>\n",
      "<p>Job came in with Margaret, for it was bed-time. He said Esther's pulse beat a little yet. They\n",
      "carried her upstairs and laid her on Mary's bed, not daring to undress her, lest any motion should\n",
      "frighten the trembling life away; but it was all in vain.</p>\n",
      "<p>Towards midnight, she opened wide her eyes and looked around on the once familiar room; Job Legh\n",
