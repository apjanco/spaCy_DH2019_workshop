# Pipelines and working with spaCy at scale
14:00-15:15, Andy and David (short session)

- pipelines
- [multi-threading](https://spacy.io/usage/examples#multi-processing)

- training data 
- training spaCy models (ner, textcat, pos, dep, semantic similarity)
- Prodigy

# spaCy Universe
9:00-10:45, Andy and David

- scattertext (finding distinguishing terms in small-to-medium-sized corpora, and presenting them in a sexy, interactive scatter plot with non-overlapping term labels)
