    "For the current problem, this is not my suggested method.  Place names are very distinct and hard to identify from context.  If the model knew that York is a place, how could it learn that New York is also a place? By contrast, titles typically occur before proper names.  It could learn that both Professor and Doctor are titles without knowing that those specific terms are used as titles.  In our current case, it's best to give the model as many examples of place names as possible.  Note that with spaCy, we are working with place names as [patterns](https://spacy.apjan.co/docs/#match-patterns) so the model can learn that place names often have several parts.  \n",

Either one works.  If we improve an existing entity, we retain the existing training and examples. A new entity makes it easier to distinguish between what we have taught the model and previous training.  This can also address potential bias in previous training data.  For that reason, we'll add \"PLACE\" as a new category.     "
