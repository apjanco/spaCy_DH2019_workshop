    "Prodigy is an annotation tool for active machine teaching.  Prodigy makes it possible to quickly experiment and improve models with relatively little data, time and typically only one annotator.

Machine teaching can be used to: \n",

If the model knew that York is a place, how could it learn that New York is also a place? By contrast, titles typically occur before proper names.  It could learn that both Professor and Doctor are titles without knowing that those specific terms are used as titles.  In our current case, it's best to give the model as many examples of place names as possible.  Note that with spaCy, we are working with place names as [patterns](https://spacy.apjan.co/docs/#match-patterns) so the model can learn that place names often have several parts.  \n",

This can also address potential bias in previous training data.  For that reason, we'll add \"PLACE\" as a new category.     "
